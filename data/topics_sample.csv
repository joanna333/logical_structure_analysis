Topic,Prompt
Regulation_BP,"Write a detailed explanation of how blood pressure is regulated in the human body, focusing on the interplay between baroreceptors, the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, and the nervous system."
Cardiac_Cycle,"Describe the cardiac cycle in detail, including the dependency between electrical conduction, mechanical contraction, and cardiac output."
Blood_Flow_Distribution,"Explain how blood flow is distributed throughout the body, emphasizing the role of arterioles, local metabolic control, and systemic hormonal control."
Exercise_Heart_Rate,"Discuss the effects of exercise on heart rate and stroke volume, highlighting the roles of sympathetic activation, venous return, and muscle oxygen demand."
Gas_Exchange,"Describe the process of gas exchange in the lungs, focusing on partial pressure gradients, diffusion, and hemoglobin saturation."
Control_Breathing,"Explain how breathing is controlled, with an emphasis on the roles of COâ‚‚ levels, chemoreceptors, and neural regulation."
VQ_Matching,"Write about ventilation-perfusion matching in the lungs, and describe what happens when air and blood flow are mismatched."
Acid_Base_Resp,"Discuss the role of the respiratory system in acid-base balance, focusing on respiratory compensation in metabolic acidosis or alkalosis."
Regulation_Osmolarity,"Describe how blood osmolarity is regulated, focusing on the interaction between ADH, aldosterone, and water reabsorption."
Renal_Function,"Explain the processes of filtration, reabsorption, and secretion in the nephron, and how they contribute to fluid balance."
