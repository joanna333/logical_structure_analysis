Computational social science," Computational social science is an interdisciplinary academic subfield concerned with computational approaches to the social sciences. It focuses on investigating social and behavioral relationships and interactions using data science approaches such as machine learning or machine learning. It has been applied in areas such as computational economics, computational sociology and cliodynamics. Social science computing SSC and computational social science CSS. In literature CSS is referred to the field of social science that uses the computational approaches in studying the social phenomena. On the other hand SSC is the field in which computational methodologies are created to assist in explanations ofsocial phenomena. Social science revolutionizes both fundamental legs of the scientific method empirical research especially through big data. It is a multidisciplinary and integrated approach to social survey focusing on information processing by means of advanced information technology. The computational tasks include the analysis of social networks.  Computational social science work increasingly relies on the greater availability of large databases. The Seshat Global History Databank systematically collects stateoftheart accounts of the political and social organization of human groups and how societies have evolved through time into an authoritative databank. The Atlas of Cultural Evolution is an archaeological database created by Peter N Peregrine. The Evolution Institute is a nonprofit thinktank that uses evolutionary science to solve realworld problems. The Collaborative Information for Historical Analysis is hosted by the University of Pittsburgh. International Institute of Social History collects data on the global social history of labour relations workers and labour. ClioInfra a database of measures of economic performance and other aspects of societal wellbeing on a global sample of societies from 1800 CE to the present. Charts frequencies of sets of commadelimited search strings using a yearly count of ngrams as found in the largest online body of human knowledge the Google Books corpus. Linguistic Data Consortium an open consortium of universities companies and government research laboratories hosted by the University of Pennsylvania.  structures can be automatically discovered in historical newspapers. A similar analysis was performed on social media again revealing strongly periodic structures Approaches as an interdisciplinary area scholars come from many different established fields. However there seems to be a shared ethos among them that the field ought to integrate knowledge across traditional scholarly boundaries. Nelimarkka proposes that five distinct archetypal approaches to computational social science. Datadriven approach perceives social science through access to new types of data sources including data from social media or smart phones. Methoddriven approach emphasises novel methods and methodological rigorous as the core area of computationalsocial science. Modeldriven approaches focuses on model building and finding universal laws which govern human behavior in societies for example social.  computational social scientists seek to address problems emerging in algorithmic society such as algorithmic bias. Social theory perspective where the aim of computational methods is to further social theory. Overall computational social science is a diverse academic enterprise. There are some scholarly works particularly from computer simulations or social physics. Computational social science articles are published across several journals such as New Media Society Social Science Computer Review PNAS Political Communication EPJ Data Science PLOS One Sociological Methods Research and Science. There are some venues focused only in computational social sciences such as IC2S2 Journal of Computational Social Science. Computational Social Science is a Springer book series. The series focuses on Computational Social Sciences. For more information on the series, visit www.springer.com/computational-social-science.
