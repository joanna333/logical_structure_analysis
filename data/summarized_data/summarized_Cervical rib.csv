Cervical rib,Cervical ribs are the ribs of the neck in many tetrapods. In humans cervical ribs are not normally present as separate structures. They can however occur as a pathology in humans. They are usually not of clinical concern although they can cause a form of thoracic outlet syndrome. A cervical rib in humans is an extra rib which arises from the seventh. In birds the cervical ribs are small and completely fused to the vertebrae. A cervical rib of Mamenchisaurus sinocanadorum was 42 metres 14 ft long. A cervical rib is a congenital abnormality located above the normal first rib. Most cases of cervical ribs are not clinically relevant and do not have symptoms. Cervical ribs are generally discovered incidentally most often during xrays and CT scans. They vary widely in size and shape and in rare cases they may cause problems. A cervical rib is a persistent ossification of the C7 lateral costal element. It can cause thoracic outlet syndrome because of pressure on the nerves that may be caused by the presence of the rib. cervical ribs can be distinguished because their appearance is different on imaging. The presence of a cervical rib can cause a form of thoracic outlet syndrome due to compression of the lower trunk of the brachial plexus or subclavian artery. These structures become encroached upon by the cervical rib and scalene muscles. Compression of the subclavian artery is often diagnosed by finding a positive Adsons sign on examination where the radial pulse in the arm is lost during abduction and external rotation of the shoulder. Recent studies have also found a high percent of cervical ribs in woolly animals.  decline in mammoth numbers may have forced inbreeding within the species which in turn had increased the number of mammoths being born with cervical ribs. Cervical ribs have been connected with leukaemia in human children so it has given scientists new evidence to believe that the mammoths extinction was attributed to the condition.
