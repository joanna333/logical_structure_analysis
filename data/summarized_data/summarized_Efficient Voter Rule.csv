Efficient Voter Rule,"In the study of voter behavior the efficient voter rule speaks to the desirability of voterdriven outcomes. It applies to situations involving negative externalities such as pollution and crime. Related efforts to achieve socially optimal quantities of externalities have long been a focus of microeconomic research. The efficient voter rule states that when individuals who receive the same harm from a problem vote on whether to eliminate that problem at a uniform cost per individual the outcome will be efficient. The Rule applies similarly to positive externalities as exemplified by the solar panel example below. Recent applications include votes on the strict enforcement of traffic laws. The vote in Tucson Arizona on whether to use cameras to catch drivers who run red lights provides one example. Possible applications include policy decisions about clean energy noise pollution overfishing mandatory immunizations smoking bans zoning septic systems. The literature explains why the efficient voter rule applies even if individuals cause differing levels of damage and if a given amount of damage from each individual is completely external. Consider a policy proposal to require each of the 100 households in an economy to rent a solar panel that costs 400 per year net of taxes. Each panel would prevent 600 worth of harm from pollution in the economy each year. Although societys 600 annual benefit from each panel exceeds the 400 annual cost each household only internalizes 6 worth of the environmental benefit. So the privately optimal decision is Residents could vote on the policy proposal. If enacted the policy would cost each household 400 per year. The total damage each household would avoid each year if the policy were enacted would be 100 x 6 600. The incentive is for households to vote in favor of the socially optimal decision. to not rent a panel. Each panel would prevent only 300 worth of harm from pollution in the economy each year again spread uniformly among 100 homes. A vote would yield the socially optimal solution. If the policy were implemented each resident would avoid its 1100 x 300 3 share of the harm from each of 100 panels yearly. Each resident would vote against the requirement and collectively the community would achieve the socially optimal outcome. fall below the 400 annual cost of a panel so each resident wouldVote against the requirements and collectively achieve the community's socially optimal outcomes. If the population of a community falls below 400, the panel's annual cost would fall below 400."
