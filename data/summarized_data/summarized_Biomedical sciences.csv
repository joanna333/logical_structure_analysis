Biomedical sciences,"Biomedical sciences are a set of sciences applying portions of natural science or formal science to develop knowledge interventions or technology. Such disciplines as medical microbiology clinical virology clinical epidemiology genetic epidemiology and biomedical engineering are medical sciences. In explaining physiological mechanisms operating in pathological processes however pathophysiology can be regarded as basic science.  defined by the UK Quality Assurance Agency for Higher Education Benchmark Statement in 2015 includes those science disciplines whose primary focus is the biology of human health and disease. Ranges from the generic study of biomedical sciences and human biology to more specialised subject areas such as pharmacology and human physiology. Biomedical Sciences are the major focus of bioscience research and funding in the 21st century. The biomedical sciences have a much wider range of academic and research activities and economic significance than that defined by hospital laboratory sciences. A subset of biomedical sciences is the science of clinical laboratory diagnosis This is commonly referred to in the UK as biomedical science or There are at least 45 different specialisms within healthcare science. These are traditionally grouped into three main divisions: life sciences, physiological science and medical physics. There are also specialisms involving medical physics or bioengineering. These include molecular toxicology, molecular pathology and blood transfusion science. The healthcare science workforce is an important part of the UKs economy. There are a number of specialisms in healthcare science in the United Kingdom. These include: Haematology, Haemostasis and thrombosis, Molecular genetics and cytogenetics and cell biology. Only 5 of the staff of the NHS work in healthcare science. 80 of all diagnoses can be attributed to their work. Every year NHS healthcare scientists carry out nearly 1 billion pathology laboratory tests. More than 12 million physiological tests support for 15 million fractions of radiotherapy. The NHS is introducing the Modernising Scientific Careers initiative to make certain that the education and training for healthcare scientists ensures flexibility to meet patient needs. Graduates of an accredited biomedical science degree programme can also apply for the NHS Scientist training programme which gives successful applicants an opportunity to work in a clinical setting. In 1912 the Institute of Biomedical Science was founded in the United Kingdom. At this point in history the field of medicine was the most prevalent sub field of biomedical science. The institute is still standing today and still regularly publishes works in the major breakthroughs in disease treatments. The IBMS today represents approximately 20000 members employed mainly in National Health Service and private laboratories. In 1928 British Scientist Alexander Fleming discovered the first antibiotic penicillin. In 1926 the first artificial pacemaker was made by Australian physician Dr Mark C Lidwell. The pacemaker rate ranged from about 80 to 120 pulses per minute and the voltage also variable from 15 to 120 volts. The 1930s was a huge era for biomedical research as this was the era where antibiotics became more widespread and vaccines started to be developed. In 1935 the idea of a polio vaccine was introduced by Dr Maurice Brodie Brodie prepared a died poliomyelitis vaccine which he then tested on chimpanzees himself and several children. Vaccine trials went poorly since the poliovirus became active in many of the human test subjects. Many subjects had fatal side effects paralyzing and causing death. Hormonal treatment for prostate cancer was implemented by Urologist and cancer researcher Charles B Huggins. If you remove the testicles from a man with prostate cancer the cancer had nowhere to spread and nothing to feed on. This advancement lead to the development of hormonal blocking drugs which is less invasive and still used today. In the 1950s we saw innovation in technology across all fields but most importantly there were many breakthroughs which led to modern medicine. On 6 March 1953 Dr Jonas Salk announced the completion of the first successful killedvirus Polio. conducted by Dr Leon O Jacobson. The vaccine was tested on about 16 million Canadian American and Finnish children in 1954. The vaccine was announced as safe on 12 April 1955. It was approved for use in the U.S. and Canada in August 1956. It is still available in the UK and Australia."
