Achilles tendon,The Achilles tendon or heel cord also known as the calcaneal tendon is a tendon at the back of the lower leg. It serves to attach the plantaris gastrocnemius calf and soleus muscles. These muscles acting via the tendon cause plantar flexion of the foot at the ankle joint and except the soleus flexion at the knee. The Achilles tendon was named in 1693 after the Greek hero Achilles. The tendon has been described as early as the time of Hippocrates who described it as the tendo magnus Latin for great tendon. cholesterol deposits xanthomas are found on the Achilles tendon. Verheyen referred to the mythological account of Achilles being held by the heel by his mother Thetis when she dipped him in the River Styx as a baby. The heel by which she held him was not touched by the water it was his one vulnerable spot hence the expression Achilles heel. He was eventually killed by a poison dart to the heel. The Achilles tendon is also known as the tendo calcaneus Latin for calcaneal tendon. The first closed rupture was described by Ambroise Pare in the sixteenth century. disabling and painful effect of an injury to this tendon. Achilles tendon connects gastrocnemius and soleus muscles to calcaneal tuberosity on calcaneus heel bone. is located at the back of the lower leg. The tendon spreads out somewhat at its lower end so that its narrowest part is about 4 cm 16 in above its widest point. The tendon is covered by the fascia and skin and stands out prominently behind the bone. A bursa lies between the tendon and the upper part of the calcaneus. Along the side of the muscle and superficial to it is the small saphenous vein. Achilles tendon is the thickest tendon in the human body. It can receive a load stress 39 times body weight during walking. Blood supply to the Achilles tendon is poor and mostly via a recurrent branch of the posterior tibial artery. Both muscles are innervated by the tibial nerve. The gastrocnemius also flexes the leg at the knee. Vibration of the tendon causes movement backwards and the illusion of a forward body tilt in standing subjects. Achilles tendinosis is the soreness or stiffness of the Achilles tendon. The most common symptoms are sharp achy pain and swelling around the tendon. This is because vibrations stimulate muscle spindles in the calf muscles. The muscle spindle alert the brain that the body is moving forward. Pain is typically worse at the start of exercise and decreases thereafter. Stiffness of the ankle may also be present. Onset is generally gradual and occurs as a result of overuse such as running. Other risk factors include trauma a lifestyle that includes little exercise highheel shoes and rheumatoid arthritis. Achilles tendinitis is relatively common. Treatment typically involves rest ice nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agents NSAIDs and physical therapy. A heel lift or orthotics may also be helpful. In those in whose symptoms last more than six months surgery may be considered. Achilles tendinosis frequently involves the mid portion of the tendon but may involve the insertion which is then known as enthesopathy. Enthesopathy may be seen in the context of advancing age it is also associated with arthritis such as gout and the seronegative. A Achilles tendon rupture is when the Achilles tendon breaks. Symptoms include the sudden onset of sharp pain in the heel. A snapping sound may be heard as the tendon breaks and walking becomes difficult. Rupture typically occurs as a result of a sudden bending up of the foot. Achilles tendon rupture occurs in about 1 per 10000 people per year. Males are more commonly affected than females. People in their 30s to 50s are most commonly affected. Treatment may be by surgery or casting with the toes somewhat pointed down. Tendon xanthomas are cholesterol deposits that commonly develop in the Achilles tendon of people with lipid metabolism disorders such as familial hypercholesterolemia. The risk of rerupture is about 25 with casting. If appropriate treatment does not occur within 4 weeks of the injury outcomes suffer. Paratendinopathy is inflammation of a connective tissue sleeve which surrounds the tendon and protects it from friction irritation and repeated trauma. Patients affected by insertional Achilles tendinopathy complain of pain on the posterior aspect of the heel and may have morning stiffness swelling with swelling. Haglund deformity is an abnormal bony prominence on the posterior aspect of heel condition. Occurs approximately 27 cm proximal from the Achilles insertional level. Can be painful and difficult closeshoes fitting due to friction and irritation. If this condition becomes chronic calcific deposits at the Achillesinsertional level may be developed. Achilles tendon is short or absent in great apes but long in arboreal gibbons and humans. It provides elastic energy storage in hopping walking and running. Achilles tendon increases top running speed by 80 and reduces running costs by more than threequarters.  absence of a welldeveloped Achilles tendon in the nonhuman African apes would preclude them from effective running both at high speeds and over extended distances. absence of an Achilles tendon would preclude the non human African apes from effectiveRunning. The Achilles tendon is a tendon that connects the Achilles tendon to the inner Achilles tendon.
