Abdomen,"The abdomen is the front part of the torso between the thorax chest and pelvis in humans and in other vertebrates. The area occupied by the abdomen is called the abdominal cavity. In arthropods it is the posterior tagma of the body it follows theThorax or cephalothorax. The abdomen is a large body cavity enclosed by the abdominal muscles at the front and to the sides and by part of the vertebral column at the back. The boundary of the abdominal cavity is the abdominal wall in front and the peritoneal surface at the rear. The abdominal cavity is continuous with and above the pelvic cavity. It is attached to the thoracic cavity by the diaphragm. Both the abdominal and pelvic cavities are lined by a serous membrane known as the parietal peritoneum. The abdomen in vertebrates contains a number of organs belonging to the digestive system and urinary system. The abdominal cavity contains most organs of the digestive system including the stomach, small intestine and the colon with its attached appendix. Other digestive organs are known as the accessory digestive organs and include the liver its attached gallbladder and the pancreas and these communicate with the rest of the system via various ducts. The abdomen contains an extensive membrane called the peritoneum. vessels including the aorta and inferior vena cava. The urinary bladder uterus fallopian tubes and ovaries may be seen as either abdominal organs or as pelvic organs. The kidneys and ureters are known as retroperitoneal organs The abdominal wall is made up of four layers. The first three layers extend between the vertebral column the lower ribs the iliac crest and pubis of the hip. All of their fibers merge towards the midline and surround the rectus abdominis in a sheath before joining up on the opposite side. The transverse abdominal muscle is flat and triangular with its fibers running horizontally. It originates from the inguinal ligament costal cartilages 712 the iliac crest and thoracolumbar fascia. The muscle is crossed by three fibrous bands called the tendinous bands.  rectus abdominis is enclosed in a thick sheath formed by fibers from each of the three muscles of the lateral abdominal wall. fibers originate at the pubis bone run up the abdomen and insert into the cartilages of the fifth sixth and seventh ribs. In the region of the groin the inguinal canal is a passage through the layers. The pyramidalis muscle is located in the lower abdomen in front of the rectus abdominis. It originates at the pubic bone and is inserted into the linea alba halfway up to the navel. This is also where weakness can form and cause inguinal hernias. The abdominal wall is split into the posterior back lateral sides and anterior front walls. The abdominal muscles assist as muscles of exhalation in the breathing process. The liver, kidneys, pancreas and spleen are all inside the abdomen. These muscles serve as protection for the inner organs. Together with the back muscles they provide postural support and are important in defining the form. When the glottis is closed and the thorax and pelvis are fixed they are integral in the cough urination defecation childbirth vomit and singing functions. The transverse abdominis muscle is the deepest muscle therefore it cannot be touched from the outside. It can greatly affect the bodys posture. The internal obliques are also deep and also affect body posture. Both of them are involved in rotation and lateral flexion of the spine.  rectus abdominis is the muscle that very fit people develop into sixpack abs though there are five vertical sections on each side. The two bottom sections are just above the pubic bone and usually not visible. Their function is to bend ones back forward flexion and stabilize the spine when upright. Social and cultural perceptions of the outward appearance of the abdomen has varying significance around the world. Depending on the type of society excess weight can be perceived as an indicator of wealth and prestige due to excess food. In many cultures bare abdomens are distinctly sexualized and perceived similarly to breast cleavage.  abdominal muscles are key elements of spinal support and contributors to good posture. It is important to properly exercise the abdominal muscles together with the back muscles. When these are weak or overly tight they can suffer painful spasms and injuries. When properly exercised abdominal muscles contribute to improved posture and balance. Abdominal obesity is a condition where abdominal fat or visceral fat has built up excessively between the abdominal organs. This is associated with a higher risk of heart disease asthma and type 2 diabetes. When strengthened the abdominal muscles provide flexibility as well. The abdominal muscles can be worked by strength and fitness exercises. A scaphoid abdomen is when the abdomen is sucked inwards. In a newborn it may represent a diaphragmatic hernia. In general it is indicative of malnutrition. Many gastrointestinal diseases affect the abdominal organs These include stomach disease liver disease pancreatic disease gallbladder. Different medical procedures can be used to examine the organs of the gastrointestinal tract. These include endoscopy colonoscopy sigmoidoscopy enteroscopy oesophagogastroduodenoscopy. Surface landmarks are important in the examination of the abdomen.  slight furrow extends from the xiphoid process above to the pubic symphysis below representing the linea alba in the abdominal wall. At about its midpoint sits the umbilicus or navel. rectus abdominis on each side of the line a alba stands out in muscular people. The outline of these muscles is interrupted by three or more transverse depressions. The upper lateral limit of the abdomen is the subcostal margin. The lower lateral limit is the anterior crest of the ilium and Pouparts ligament. These lower limits are marked by visible grooves Just above the pubic spines on either side.  external abdominal rings. are openings in the muscular wall of the abdomen through which the spermatic cord emerges in the male and through which an inguinal hernia may rupture. One method by which the location of the abdominal contents can be appreciated is to draw three horizontal and two vertical lines.  pyloric opening of the stomach an inch to the right of the midline. The hilum of each kidney is a little below it while its left end approximately touches the lower limit of the spleen. It corresponds to the first lumbar vertebra behind. The third line is called the intertubercular line and runs across between the two rough tubercles which can be felt on the outer lip of the crest of the ilium. This line corresponds to the body of the fifth lumbar vertebra and passes through or just above the ileocaecal valve. The right one is the most valuable as the ileocaecal valve is situated where it cuts the intertubercular line. In its upper part the vertical line meets the transpyloric line at the lower margin of the ribs usually the ninth. The abdomen can be divided into quadrants or regions to describe the location of an organ or structure. Quadrants are also often used in describing the site of an abdominal pain. The right subcostal margin corresponds to the lower limit of the liver while the right nipple is about half an inch above its upper limit. The right iliac fossa RIF is a common site of pain and tenderness in patients who have appendicitis. Most. also be divided into nine regions. These terms stem from hypo meaning below and epi means above while chondron means cartilage. Abdominal organs can be highly specialized in some mammals. of the anatomical structures that will produce pain and tenderness in this region are not in fact in the concavity of the ileum. However the term is in common usage across animal phyla and classes. In insects the abdomen contains the insects digestive tract and reproductive organs. It consists of eleven segments in most orders of insects though the eleventh segment is absent in the adult of most higher orders. The number of these segments does vary from species to species with the number of segments visible reduced to seven in the common honey bee. Unlike other arthropods insects possess no legs on the abdomen in adult form. In Apocrita bees ants and wasps the first segment of the abdomen is fused to the thorax and is called the propodeum. The petiole and gaster abdominal segments 2 and onward are collectively called the metasoma. Many larval insects including the Lepidoptera and the Symphyta sawflies have fleshy appendages called prolegs on their abdominal segments. The Protura do have rudimentary leglike appendages on the first three abdominal segments and Archaeognatha possess small articulated styli which are sometimes considered to be rudimentary appendages. The term abdomen is used interchangeably with opisthosoma hind body which is the body section posterior to that bearing the legs and head. The prosoma or cephalothorax is the part of the body that bears the head and legs."
