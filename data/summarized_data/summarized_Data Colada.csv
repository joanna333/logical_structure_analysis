Data Colada,"Data Colada is a blog dedicated to investigative analysis and replication of academic research. It is known for its advocacy against problematic research practices such as phacking. It has published evidence of data manipulation and research misconduct in several prominent cases including celebrity professors Dan Ariely and Francesca Gino. Data Colada was established in 2013 by three behavioral science researchers. Nelson and Simonsohn bonded over the false ridiculous and flashy findings that the field of behavioral sciences was capable of producing. They reacted by publishing an influential 2011 paper about false clairvoyance claims. Nelson is a professor at University of California Berkeley and Simmons is a University of Pennsylvania History professor. The Data Colada blog was launched two years later in 2013 carrying the tagline Thinking about evidence and vice versa. The New York Times described it as a hub for nerdy discussions of statistical methods and before long various research crimes and misdemeanors. In particular the parody research finding that supposedly showed that listening to the Beatles song When Im SixtyFour made experimental subjects one and a half years younger. Three researchers objected to the then widespread practice of cherrypicking data and attempts to make insignificant results appear statistically credible. They coined the term phacking in a 2014 paper. Data Colada also published evidence of data manipulations and research misconduct. These include studies about the concept of the moral high ground. In 2021 Data Colada discovered fabricated data in a 2012 field study published in PNAS by Lisa L Shu, Nina Mazar, Dan Ariely and Max H Bazerman. research by Flemish psychologist Dirk Smeesters. All of the studys authors agreed with their assessment and the paper was retracted. Ariely denied manipulating the data but Excel metadata showed that he created the spreadsheet and was the last to edit it. He also admitted to having mislabeled all of the values in an entire column of the data. Ariely has stated that someone at the insurance agency that provided the data must have fabricated it. Data Colada is recognized for helping to establish better research practices such as the sharing of replication data. The Nobelprize winning psychologist Daniel Kahneman described Data Colada in 2023 as heroes of mine. Brian Nosek of the Center for Open Science applauded Data. Data Colada's harshest critics saw the young men as jealous upstarts. Psychologist Norbert Schwarz accused Data Colada and other reformers of engaging in a witch hunt. psychologist Daniel Gilbert denounced what he called the replication police as shameless little bullies. Harvard behavioral scientist Francesca Gino has been placed on unpaid leave. Gino is the subject of a lawsuit filed by Harvard Business School. Harvard conducted its own internal investigation with the help of an outside firm which discovered additional data alterations besides the cases raised by Data Colada. Gino filed a defamation suit against Harvard Harvard Business School Dean Srikant Datar and the three members of Data Colada for 25 million alleging that they had conspired to falsify data. Gino was placed on administrative leave after the internal investigation determined she had falsified data in her research. Around the same time Data ColADA published four blog posts detailing evidence that the four papers all of which had been retracted or set to be retracted at that point were fake. Gino accused Harvard and the Data Colada team of having worked together to destroy my career and reputation despite admitting they have no evidence proving their allegations. The lawsuit raised concerns about chilling effects Open science proponent Simine Vazire raised over 370000 to help cover the legal fees. On September 11 2024 the judge dismissed all of Ginos claims. Ginos. claims against the Data Colada defendants defamation and other claims were dismissed. Ginos defamation and certain other claims such as violation of privacy against the Harvard University defendants were also dismissed. Some breach of contract claims against Harvard were allowed to continue."
