Belief congruence,"Belief congruence was first proposed by Milton Rokeach in 1960. Belief is more important than ethnic or racial membership as a determinant of social discrimination. Similar beliefs promote liking and social harmony among people while dissimilar beliefs produce dislike and prejudice. The principle states that we value beliefs and people based on how closely they align with our own beliefs. This principle was further elaborated by himself later in 1965 that belief system is a crucial alignment point for individuals. prejudice arises from how people react to differences or lack of congruence in belief systems. Rokeach and his colleagues designed an experiment to separate the effects of group membership from belief congruence on individuals preferences. Participants rated their liking for people who were either part of their own group or a different one and who had beliefs that were either similar or dissimilar to them. Study found shared beliefs were a stronger predictor of liking than simply belonging to the same group. This was illustrated by instances where white participants preferred a black individual with similar beliefs over a white individual with differing beliefs. Another set of findings from researchers illustrated the powerful effects of belief prejudice over racial categorisation. Social identity theory believes that race effects could potentially potentially affect how we connect with or judge others. Social identity is the portion of an individuals selfconcept that comes from their awareness of being part of a social group or groups and the emotional importance they place on this membership. sharing similar beliefs often matters more than race in how we connected with or judged others. Race effects. result from comparative judgments individuals make to preserve their social worth or identity. Even though Tajfel didnt directly connect social identity to belief congruence theories his ideas are still very applicable. For instance he believes that comparing ourselves with others is what connects our social categories to our sense of who we are 70. Belief congruence theory has also generated a large number of vigorous critiques testing the theorys hypothesis is challenging because membership in social or ethnic groups often overlaps with similarities within groups and differences between them in many key areas. Race was found more important than belief when it comes to more intimate relationships such as friendship. Critiques argue that belief congruence primarily addresses discrimination in contexts of small social distance. Theorys applicability to scenarios involving larger social distances such as neighbourhood or university settings where prejudice and discrimination might manifest differently remains questioned. Michael Diehls research provides a conclusively finding individuals generally prefer those with similar beliefs. Outgroups with beliefs similar to the ingroup actually faced more prejudice and discrimination compared to those with differing beliefs. Another limitation supported by the socialpressure hypothesis of belief congruence theory is that in environments where prejudice is institutionalised or socially accepted belief Congruence does not apply and prejudice simply becomes a matter of ethnic group membership. weak version of belief congruence theory. Milton Rokeachs said in 1981 that belief systems are the only factors that need to be considered when analysing prejudice and discrimination. Most studies about this theory are lack of significance tests between belief and race effects. Moe et al 1981 differentiate between two forms of belief congruence theory a strong version and a weak version. The strong version posits that discrimination is entirely based on belief Congruence. The weak version suggests that belief consequence accounts for a larger portion of discrimination variance than do perceived physical differences. The impact of race diminishes the distinction between the strong and weak versions of the theory. influence does not negate the impact of racial or ethnic differences. Its also important to note that as the impact. of race reduces, the theory becomes progressively less relevant for immediate practical purposes."
