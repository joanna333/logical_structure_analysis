Anatomical terms of neuroanatomy,This article describes anatomical terminology that is used to describe the central and peripheral nervous systems. Anatomical terminology in neuroanatomy uses specific terminology to describe anatomical structures. This terminology helps ensure that a structure is described accurately with minimal ambiguity. Terms also help ensure that structures are described consistently depending on their structure or function. Anatomical terms of location depend on the location and species that is being described. Terms are often derived from Latin and Greek and like other areas of anatomy are generally standardised based on internationally accepted lexicons. To help with consistency humans and other species are assumed when described to be in standard anatomical position. For. localisation consider an animal with a straight CNS such as a fish or lizard. In such animals the terms rostral caudal ventral and dorsal mean respectively towards the rostrum towards the tail towards the belly and towards the back. For a full discussion of those terms see anatomical terms of location. Standard terms used throughout anatomy include anterior posterior for the front and back of a structure. Some terms are used more commonly in neuroanatomy particularly Rostral and caudal. In animals with linear nervous systems the term rostral from the Latin rostrum meaning beak is synonymous with anterior. Human nervous system considered to bend about 90 degrees. This is considered to occur at the junction of the midbrain and diencephalon. The terminology is the same as in animals with linear nervous systems. rostral is synonymous with anterior and caudal is. In animals with linear nervous systems the term dorsal from the Latin dorsum meaning back is synonymous with superior. In humans however the terminology differs on either side of the midbraindiencephalic junction Superior to the junction the terminology is rostral and caudal. In animals with linear nervous systems dorsal is synonymous with superior and ventral with inferior. inferior to the midbraindiencephalic junction the term dorsal is. synonymous with posterior. Contralateral and ipsilateral referring to a corresponding position on the opposite left or right side the sagittal plane and on the same side ipilateral respectively. In humans and many other primates the axis of the central nervous system is not straight but bent to allow for forward vision when the body is vertical. This means that differences in terminology are needed to reflect the differences between the brains of primates and brains of nearly all other vertebrates. For example to describe the human brain rostral still means towards the beak or snout. The rostrocaudal axis of the human central nervous system makes a near 90 bend at the level of the midbrain and continues through the brainstem and spinal cord. Caudal means towards the tail Latin cauda but not towards the back of the cranial cavity which is posterior behind in ordinary motion. In human anatomy the occipital lobes are posterior but not caudal to the frontal lobes and the face. In quadrupeds the brain is anterior forward in motion to the spinal cord. Dorsal means in the direction away from the ridge of the human back or its equivalent in other animals. Ventral in. meaning towards to top of the head or the soles of the feet when standing. The three axes of the human brain match the three planes within which they lie. The most commonly used reference planes are Axial or transverse or horizontal. the central nervous system also refers to the rostrocaudal axis which changes within the head. There is no term paracoronal comparable to the commonly used parasagittal Sagittal a vertical plane that passes from between the nostrils and between the cerebral hemispheres dividing the brain into left and right halves Median plane specifically defines the midline between left andright sides of the body It contains the dorsoventral and medial axes of the brain. A parasagittal plane is any plane parallel to the sagittal plane Nerves Function Specific terms are used for peripheral nerves that originate from or arrive at a specific point. An afferent nerve fiber is a fibre originating at the present point. A chiasm from Greek Chi is used to describe different types of crossings of or within peripheral nerve fibres between the cerebral hemispheres. A decussation from Latin decussis ten written as a capital X refers to nerve fibers that cross the sagittal plane from one side of the central to the other. There are two kinds of Mauthner cells. Type 1 crosses the sagittal plane in the same brain region or spinal segment where the cell body is located. The second type is thought to be due to an axial twist such that each. nervous system is connected to the other. A commissure is a bilateral connection of axons connecting the left and right side of the same brain region. For example nerve fibre tracts that cross between the two cerebral hemispheres are called commissures. A ganglion can also have the form of crossing. The difference between a chiasm and a decussation is that the first refers to peripheral nerves whereas the latter refers to crossings inside central nervous system. A ganglion always contains synapses between neurons as well as their cell bodies. The other kinds of nerve crossings never contain synapses of cell bodies of neurons. A gyrus is an outward folding of the brain for example the precentral gyrus A sulcus is an inward fold or valley in the brains surface. A fissure is used to describe A deep groove produced by opercularisation An example is the Sylvian Fissure. Some common acronyms include MRI Magnetic Resonance Imaging and CT Computed tomography. differentiation of the telencephalic vesicles An example is the longitudinal fissure also known as the interhemispheric fissures.
