Change and continuity,The question of change and continuity is considered a classic discussion in the study of historical developments. The dichotomy is used to discuss and evaluate the extent to which a historical development or event represents a decisive historical change or whether a situation remains largely unchanged. The issue here is if the New Deal marks something radically new change in US history or if it can be understood as a continuation continuity of tendencies in American history.
