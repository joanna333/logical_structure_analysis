Dental anatomy,"Dental anatomy is a field of anatomy dedicated to the study of human tooth structures. It is also a taxonomical science concerned with the naming of teeth and the structures of which they are made. Tooth formation begins before birth and the teeths eventual morphology is dictated during this time. There are 20 primary baby teeth and 32 permanent teeth. The last four are third molars or wisdom teeth each of which may or may not grow in. Among primary teeth 10 usually are found in the maxilla upper jaw and the other 10 in the mandible lower jaw. Enamel dentin cementum and the periodontium must all develop during appropriate stages of fetal development for human teeth to have a healthy oral environment. Primary baby teeth start to form between the sixth and eighth weeks in utero and permanent teeth begin to form in the twentieth week. The tooth bud sometimes called the tooth germ is an aggregation of cells that eventually forms a tooth. The tooth bud is organized into three parts the enamel organ the dental papilla and the dental follicle. It is widely accepted that there is a factor within the tissues of the first branchial arch that is necessary for the development of teeth. The growth of cervical loop cells into the deeper tissues forms Hertwigs Epithelial Root Sheath which determines the root shape of the tooth. The dental papilla contains cells that develop into odontoblasts which are dentinforming cells. The dental follicle gives rise to three important entities cementoblasts osteoblasts and fibroblasts. Cementoblasts form the cementum of a tooth. Osteoblasts give rise to the alveolar bone around the roots of teeth. Fibroblast develop the periodontal ligaments which connect teeth to theAlveolar Bone through cementum. Teeth are named by their sets and also arch class type and side. Teeth can belong to one of two sets of teeth primary baby teeth or permanent teeth Often it is difficult to. categorize changes that take place along a continuum frequently it is. difficult to decide what stage should be assigned to a particular developing tooth. Succedaneous refers to those teeth of the permanent dentition that replace primary teeth incisors canines and premolars. Further the name depends upon which arch the tooth is found in. maxillary is given to teeth in the upper jaw and mandibular to those in the lower jaw. Premolars are found only in permanent teeth there are no premolars in deciduous teeth. Incisors are divided further into central and lateral incisors Among premolars and molars there are first and second premolars. First and second molars and first second and third molars. There are several dental notation systems for associating information to a specific tooth. The three most commons systems are the FDI World Dental Federation notation Universal numbering system dental and Palmer notation method. The FDI system is used worldwide and the universal is used widely in the United States. The Palmer notation was developed by the Austrian dentist Adolf Zsigmondy in 1861. Permanent teeth are numbered 1 to 8 and primary teeth are indicated by a letter A to E. The universal numbering system uses a unique unique numbering system. The FDI system uses a twodigit numbering system in which the first number represents a tooths quadrant and the first letter or number for each tooth. The uppercase letters A through T are used for primary teeth and the numbers 1 32 are used to designate permanent teeth. Second number represents the number of the tooth from the midline of the face. For primary teeth the sequence of numbers goes 5 6 7 and 8 for the teeth in the upper right upper left lower left and lower right respectively. As a result any given tooth has three different ways to identify it depending on which tooth it is. The palmer system uses the number and symbol 1 to identify the tooth. The number 12 may signify the permanent left maxillary first premolar in the universal system or the permanent right maxillary central incisor in the FDI system. In 1891 Victor Haderup devised a variant of eight tooth quadrant system in which plus and minus were used to differentiate between upper and lower quadrants. Primary teeth were numbered as upper right 05 to 01 lower left 01 to 05 This system is still used in Denmark. The anatomic crown of a tooth refers to the area above the cementoenamel junction CEJ or neck of the tooth. The bulk of the crown is composed of dentine with the pulp chamber within. The crown is enclosed within bone before the tooth erupts but after eruption the crown becomes completely covered in enamel.  anatomic root is found below the cementoenamel junction and is covered with cementum. clinical root is any part of a tooth not visible in the mouth. Dentin composes most of the root which normally has pulp canals. roots of teeth may be single in number singlerooted teeth or multiple Canines and most premolars. The tooth is supported in bone by an attachment apparatus known as the periodontium which interacts with the root. Maxillary first premolars and mandibular molars usually have two roots Maxillary molarsusually have three roots. usually have one root Maxillary  first premolars and mandibular molars have two roots. Mesial signifies a surface closer to the median line of the face which is located on a vertical axis between the eyes down the nose and. be described as palatal when found on maxillary teeth beside the hard palate. Surfaces that aid in chewing are known as occlusal on posterior teeth and incisal on anterior teeth A cusp is an elevation on an occlusal surface of posterior teeth and canines. It contributes to a significant portion of the tooths surface. Canines have one cusp Maxillary premolars and the mandibular first premolars usually have two cusps. A cingulum is a convexity mesiodistally resembling a girdle encircling the lingual surface at the cervical third found on anterior teeth. that may form on the maxillary first molar is known as the cusp of Carabelli Mandibular molars may have five or four cusps. The cingulum forms from this lingual lobe of development. The majority of a lingual surfaces cervical third is made up of the cedulum. Maxillary canines have a large welldeveloped cingum whereas the cinguma of mandibular canines is smoother and rounded. The labial ridge is one that runs cervicoincisally in approximately the center of the labial surface of canines. The lingual ridge extends from the cingulum to the cusp tip on the lingual surface of most canines The cervical ridge runs mesiodistally on the cervical third of the buccal surface of the crown. These are found on all primary teeth but only on the permanent molars. Triangular ridges project from the cusp tips of premolar and molars to the central groove. Transverse ridges are formed by the union of two triangular ridges on posterior teeth. The joining of buccal and lingual triangular ridge is usually named as an example.  oblique ridge is found on the occlusal surfaces of maxillary molars. It is formed by the union of the distal cusp ridge of the mesiolingual cusp and the triangular ridge of  the distobuccal cusk. Embrasures are triangularly shaped spaces located between the proximal surfaces of adjacent teeth. borders of embrasures are formed by the interdental papilla of the gingiva the adjacent teeth and the contact point where the two teeth meet. There are four embrasures for every contact area facial. Embrasures have three functions. They form spillways between teeth to direct food away from the gingiva. They provide a mechanism for teeth to be more self cleansing. Lastly they protect theGingiva from undue frictional trauma. absence of adequate gingival tissue a black angle is visible. Mamelons may not be visible on teeth of older people. Best chance to see this characteristic is soon after eruption of the tooth into the mouth. Eight incisors are anterior teeth. Four in the upper arch and four in the lower. Their function is for shearing or cutting food during chewing. Maxillary central incisors are usually the most visible teeth since they are the top center two teeth in the front of a mouth. They are located mesial to the maxillary lateral incisor. The overall length of the deciduous maxillary centralincisor is 16 mm on average. The permanent maxillary central incisor is the widest tooth mesiodistally in comparison to any other anterior tooth. It is larger than the neighboring lateral incisors. The diameter of the crown is greater than the length cervicoincisally which makes the tooth appear wider rather than taller. The maxillary lateral incisor is the tooth located distally from both maxillary central incisors of the mouth and the maxillary central incisor. usually not as convex on its labial surface. As a result the central inci appears to be more rectangular or square in shape. Mandibular central incisor is the tooth located on the jaw adjacent to the midline of the face. mesially from both maxillary canines. Canine cuspid is a tooth located distally from both mandibularcentral incisors of the mouth. It is mesial from both mandibular lateral incisors and mesially from both mandiular canines. The most common action of the canines is tearing of food. located three teeth away from the midline and separate the premolars from the incisors. The maxillary canine is the tooth located laterally from both premolars and incisor during chewing. Mandibular canine is the tooth located distally from both mandibular lateral incisors of the mouth but mesially from both maxillary first premolars. It is the longest tooth in total length from root to incisal edge in the mouth. Premolar bicuspid is found distal to canines and mesial to molars. The maxillary first premolar is the tooth located laterally from both the maxillary canines of the mouth but mesially from both maxillary second premolars. The function of this premolars is similar to that of canines in regard to tearing being the principal action during chewing. The maxillary second premolar is the tooth located laterally from both the maxillary first premolars of the mouth. It is also bifurcated with two roots. The function of this premolars is similar to that of first molars in regard to grinding. Mandibular first premolar is located laterally from both the mandibular canines of the mouth but mesially from bothmandibular second premolars. This premolar has two cusps, one large and sharp and the other less sharp. Mandibular second premolar is the tooth located distally from both the mandibular first premolars of the mouth. It is also located mesially from both mandIBular first molars. It has three cusps, the lingual cusp is nonfunctional. Molars are the most posterior teeth in the mouth. Their function is to grind food during chewing. There is one large cusp on the buccal side of the tooth. The number of cusps and thus the overall appearance vary among the different molars and between people. The maxillary first molar is the tooth located laterally from both the maxillary second premolars of the mouth. It is not considered to have any teeth that precede it. The third molars are commonly called wisdom teeth. The deciduous molars and the permanent molars have different functions. There are usually four cusps on maxillary molars two on the buccal and two palatal. Most times there is also a fifth cusp called the Cusp of Carabelli located on the mesiolingual aspect of the tooth. The maxillary second molar is the tooth located laterally from both the maxillary first molars of the mouth. The maxillary third molar is the tooth located laterally from both the maxillary second molars of the mouth with no tooth posterior to it in permanent teeth. There are usually four cusps on maxillary molars two buccal and two palatal. Mandibular first molar is the tooth located distally from both the mandibular second premolars of the mouth but mesially from both mandIBular second molars. It is located on themandibular arch of the mouths. It generally opposes the maxillary first molars and themaxillary 2nd premolar. There are usually five welldeveloped cusps on mandibular first molars. Two on the buccal, two lingual and one distal Mandibular second molar is the tooth located distally from both the mandibula first molar of the mouth but mesially from bothmandibular third molars in permanent teeth. Mandibular third molar is the tooth located distally from both the mandibular second molars of the mouth with no tooth posterior to it in permanent teeth. For this tooth there are great variances among third molars and a specific of aThird molar will not hold true in all cases."
