Anti-asthmatic agent,An antiasthmatic agent can aid in airway smooth muscle dilation to allow normal breathing during an asthma attack or reduce inflammation on the airway. The goal of asthmatic agents is to reduce asthma exacerbation frequencies and related hospital visits. Antiasthmatic agents as rescue medications for acute asthma attacks include shortacting β2adrenergic receptor agonists SABA shortacting. Antiasthmatic agents as maintenance medications for asthmatic symptom control include longacting β2adrenergic receptor agonists. muscarinic antagonists SAMA systemic glucocorticoids and magnesium sulfate. Global Initiative of Asthma GINA is the official guideline on the usage of antiasthmatic Agents. GINA guideline outlines the class dosage and administration of antiasthmatic agents prescription depending on the severity of asthma symptoms. Inhaled shortacting β2adrenergic agonists such as terbutaline and salbutamol are the firstline drugs indicated for asthma exacerbation.  β2adrenergic agonists can trigger the activation of Gs proteincoupled receptors on the airway smooth muscle cells in the lungs. The receptors activation allows the adenylyl cyclase to catalyse the conversion of ATP to cAMP cAMP. Shortacting muscarinic antagonists such as oxitropium and ipratropium can be used as an adjunct therapy with shortacting β2adrenergic agonists in moderate to severe asthma exacerbations to achieve bronchodilation. The incidence and severity of side effects depend on the dose and route of administration. Muscarinic antagonists can compete with acetylcholine for muscarinic receptors. They can cause inhibition of cholinergic bronchomotor tone and hence bronchodilation. They commonly cause dry mouth throat irritation and dizziness. Systemic glucocorticoids are indicated for moderate to severe asthma.  glucocorticoids can reduce airway mucus production. It can also suppress inflammatory responses by inhibiting the synthesis and release of inflammatory mediators. It is important for patients with refractory asthma exacerbation who are already on intensive bronchodilator therapy as airflow resistance in the airway is likely to be caused by mucus accumulation.  glucocorticoids may cause depressed immunity osteoporosis and Cushings syndrome. Magnesium Sulfate Magnesium sulfate is indicated for severe or lifethreatening asthma exacerbation to achieve bronchodilation. Intravenous magnesium is also indicated.  magnesium sulfate can reduce calcium ions influx into smooth muscle cells on the airway causing airway muscle relaxation. It is possible for intravenous magnesium sulfates to cause hypermagnesemia resulting in muscle weakness. Intravenous Mag. sulfate is contraindicated in patients with renal insufficiency. Inhaled corticosteroids are commonly used together with longacting β2adrenergic agonists in maintenance therapy. Corticosteroid may commonly cause dysphonia and overgrowth of oropharyngeal candidiasis. The risk of overgrowth can be reduced by rinsing the mouth with water after inhaled cortiosteroid. Muscarinic antagonists can reduce cholinergic bronchomotor tone resulting in airway muscle relexation and bronchodilation. Methylxanthine Phosphodiesterase Inhibitors commonly cause dry mouth throat irritation and dizziness. Methylxanthines act as a competitive inhibitor of phosphodiesterase. This resulted accumulation of cAMP relaxes smooth muscles leading to dilation of airways. that can achieve bronchodilation and reduce bronchospasm. Methylxanthines are not routinely used owing to their adverse effect profiles and the risk of toxicity. Adverse effects include nervousness insomnia irritability anxiety gastrointestinal disturbance and vomiting tremor. induce asthma attacks and exacerbations achieving antiinflammatory effects For asthma maintenance therapy methylxanthine are taken orally. Leukotriene receptor antagonists include montelukast and zafirlukast. They inhibit proinflammatory leukotrienes bindings to LTC4 and LTD4 receptors. This blocks the downstream inflammatory pathways that lead to bronchospasm and smooth muscle contractions in asthmatic patients. Mast cell stabilizers are drugs that inhibit the degranulation and activation of mast cells upon contact with antigen. This prevents the subsequent release of proinflammatory mediators such as histamines and leukotrienes. Mast cell stabilizer are given as prophylactic treatment to prevent exacerbation of asthmatic symptoms. Mast cell stabilizers include mouth dryness cough throat irritation nasal congestion and bronchospasm. Omalizumab binds to free human immunoglobulin IgE to reduce IgE level in circulation. This reduces the subsequent binding of IgE receptors on inflammatory cells including mast cells basophils and dendritic cells.  of inflammatory mediators is then prevented Mepolizumab and reslizumac inhibit Interleukin IL5 binding with IL5 receptors on the surface of eosinophils inhibiting subsequent inflammatory responses. Benralizmab blocks the IL5 receptor on basophils preventing binding of IL5 with IL4 receptors. Monoclonal antibodies for the treatment of asthmatic symptoms are given by subcutaneous injections. Common adverse effects include local site reactions joint pain back pain headache and sore throat Treatment steps GINA guideline According to the Global Initiative of Asthma GINA the guideline for antiasthmatic treatment is divided into 5 levels. The 5 levels derived from the severity of asthma depend on the occurrence of symptoms and their frequencies. These symptoms include bronchoconstriction shortness of breath and wheezing that exacerbates after physical activities. These 5 levels are indicators of what drug treatments should be. The guideline is as follows Step 12 Symptoms less than 45 days a week. Lowdose inhaled corticosteroids and formoterol combination therapy when required. administered. Shortcourse oral cortiosteroids when required in the hospital. administered Consider high dose inhaled corticosteroids and formoterol maintenance therapy. Consider AntiIgE antiiL55R antiIL4Rα or antiTSLP Reliever Asneededonly low dose ICSformoterol. Shortacting β2adrenergic agonist is that this dosage regimen shows a reduction in the severe asthma exacerbation risk. As inhaled formoterol medications are often accompanied by a corticosteroid this combination is a simpler regimen for patients.
