Clinical physiology,"Clinical physiology is an academic discipline within the medical sciences and a clinical medical specialty for physicians in the health care systems of Sweden Denmark and Finland. Clinical physiology is characterized as a branch of physiology that uses a functional approach to understand the pathophysiology of a disease. Test methods include evaluation of electrical activity eg electrocardiogram of the heart blood pressure eg ankle brachial pressure index and air flow. In addition Clinical Physiologists measure movements velocities and metabolic processes through imaging techniques such as ultrasound echocardiography magnetic resonance imaging. The field of clinical physiology was originally founded by Professor Torgny Sj√∂strand in Sweden. It continues to make its way around the world in other hospitals and academic environments. photon emission computed tomography SPECT and positron emission tomography PET with and without CT or MRI.  PK Anokhin Anohkin heavily contributed to the branch of physiology where he worked diligently to use his theories of functional systems to solve medical mysteries amongst his patients. Between 2008 and 2015 clinical physiology was categorized as a subdiscipline to radiology. Those pursuing a career in clinical physiology had to first become registered and certified radiologists before.  clinical physiology is once again a separate discipline independent of radiology. Human physiology is the study of bodily functions. Clinical physiology examinations typically involve assessments of such functions as opposed to assessments of structures and anatomy. The specialty encompasses the development of new physiological tests for medical diagnostics. Clinical Physiology departments perform tests from related medical specialties including nuclear medicine clinical neurophysiology and radiology. In the health care systems of countries that lack this specialty the tests performed in clinical physiology are often performed by the various organspecific specialties in internal medicine.  clinical physiology is not a medical specialty for physicians. It is individually a nonmedical allied health profession scientist physiologist or technologist who may practice as a cardiac scientist vascular scientist respiratory scientist sleep scientist. These professionals also aid in the diagnosis of disease and manage patients.  physiologists are audiologists, cardiac physiologists, gastrointestinal physiologists neurophysiologists respiratory physiologists and sleep physiologists. Disciplines within clinical physiology field include cardiologists, gastrophysiists, respiratory physiologist, sleep physiologist and sleep physiologist."
