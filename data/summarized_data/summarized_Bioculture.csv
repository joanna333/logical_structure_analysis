Ethics in Bioculture come into question especially in situations where the animals are in artificially created environments that are completely controlled by human. In such situations humans control not only the animals but also the plants. Plants and animals could be bred by humans to be later consumed or utilized by humans in some way. For example agricultural farming for food and clothing breeding raising and then slaughtering animals for food. forests to eventually cut them for wood or breeding animals and plants and experimenting on them. Humans decide how the life of the nonhuman organism will be led. Animals and plants could be bred for entertainment purposes also. For example developing plant nurseries to harvest flowers building and maintaining zoos aquariums for entertainment. breeding animals for sports like horse riding or bull fighting pet trade. Not all plants and animals raised in Bioculture are treated badly or are hurt. Some as in case of pet trade the pets are looked after The pet owner is considered to be responsible. nonhuman organism is bred with the end goal to benefit humans. Paul Taylor asks in his book on the fairness of hurting these animals and plants for our benefit or fun. Even when we dont have love and affection towards some stranger moral ethics require us to behave. for taking care of all things pertaining to the pet. The question then arises as to how this translate this ethical duty and responsibility to the field of Bioculture for plants and animals. Well with them well with them. The question is how do we apply this to the world of plants and animal?"
