Dorsal pancreatic agenesis,Dorsal pancreatic agenesis is a congenital anomaly characterised by the absence of the duct of Santorini tail and body of the pancreas. It is regarded as asymptomatic and the most common clinical manifestation is nonspecific abdominal pain. While the cause is unclear its mechanism is thought to be impaired dorsal buds or mutation of genes. This malformation is associated with other pancreatic disorders including pancreatitis and pancreatic tumors. No specific medications are needed for relieving symptoms but pancreatic enzymes capsule and insulin are prescribed. Patients with this dysgenesis are usually accompanied by a family member. The agenesis of the dorsal pancreas is asymptomatic in most cases. It is often diagnosed incidentally by autopsy surgery endoscopy or imaging technologies during evaluation of other diseases. First reported in 1911 by Heiberg in an autopsy. Abdominal pain could be associated with acute or chronic pancreatitis pancreatic tumor diabetic autonomic neuropathy and weight loss. It can also be due to diabetes mellitus in some patients. The localisation of abdominal pain is at epigastrium and aggregates after meals. Dorsal pancreatic agenesis may result in a defect in the metabolism of hepatic glycogen which may be related to the reduced β cell mass. Pancreatitis is a common disorder associated with dorsal pancreatic Agenesis. However it is unclear whether the high occurrence of pancreatitis is due to the dorsal pancreas. Insulin is produced by the β cells of the islet of Langerhans in the dorsal pancreas. In patients with agenesis the amount of β cells are reduced thus leading to a high possibility of causing diabetes mellitus. Diabetes mellitus is an endocrine disease that is due to insufficient amount of insulin. Pancreatic tumors can also be associated with dorsal pancreatic agenesis. Reported pancreatic tumors include solid papillary solid pseudopapillary tumors adenocarcinomas and intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms. The dorsal pancreatic bud is the ancestor for the majority of pancreas. One possible explanation to this rare anomaly is the dorsal mesentery ischemia which induces the dysgenesis of pancReas. Some scholars have speculated the mode of inheritance of this agenesis which is autosomaldominant or Xlinked disease. The formation of dorsal and ventral buds is reliant on the interaction of transcription factors for instance the Pax4 Pax6 and Ptf1a. By expressing sonic hedgehog Shh or Indian hedgehog Ihh the growth of both dorsal and Ventral buds from the foregut endoderm is repressed to a large extent.  PDX1 also known as Ipf1 insulin promoter factor 1 is the initiator of buds expression. CDH2 CD352 gene encoded Neuralcadherin is identified to have a active role in recruiting dorsal pancreatic mesenchyme. Research suggests that retinoid acid is significant for the development of pancreas. Depletion of Ncadherin in mice can lead to the apoptosis of dorsal pancreatic mesenchyme cells. deficiency of retinoids acid can induce dorsal Pancreas agenesis in mice. The pancreas is formed by the convergence of the two pancreatic buds dorsal and ventral during the sixth and seventh week of gestation. Its 15 cm entity is divided into three parts a globular head attached to the right side of duodenum a long body and a blunt head. The development of the pancreas. takes place at week 4. The dorsal bud develops from the dorsal mesentery and form the body and tail of the Pancreas while the ventral bud arises inferior to form the head. Two weeks later the ventrals will rotate dorsally and fuse with the dorsal bud to form pancrea. Pancreatic Divisum is the most prevalent one followed by Pancreatic Heterotopia. The agenesis of dorsal pancreas can be classified into two classes based on the morphological features complete and partial. For the former one the accessory pancreatic duct also known as duct of Santorini as well as the body and tail are missing. Dorsal pancreatic agenesis with advancement in modern day technology is currently diagnosed with the following imaging technologies and sometimes a combination of these methods Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography ERCP An invasive operatordependent gold standard for diagnosis. Cholangiopancreatography MRCP is a noninvasive accurate type of MRI to depict the major and accessory pancreatic ducts. Computed Tomography CT can be used to diagnose dorsal pancreatic agenesis by an absence of pancreatic tissue ventral to the splenic vein. The absence of pancreatic body and tail is the usual manifestation of dorsal pancreatic agenesis. The density and morphological features of the pancreatic head should be either normal or slightly enlarged due to compensation of the absent body. The diagnostic ability depends on pancreatic bowel gas or the patients body habitus.  CT is a visualisation tool that can be used to exclude both pancreatic tumors and abdominal tumors which allows for improved observation. Majority of dorsal pancreatic agenesis cases are diagnosed incidentally and asymptomatic hence there is no special medication. Oral administration of pancreatic enzymes including lipase protease and amylase is useful for relieving EPI related symptoms. Pay attention to drugs that may interact with pancreatic enzyme such as Acarbose and Miglitol 2 Exogenous insulin. Dorsal pancreatic agenesis is an extremely rare disease there are only about 100 cases reported so far. First reported in 1911 by Heiberg in an autopsy. Exogenous insulin can be used to treat the accompanied Diabetes Mellitus. Two years later the second case was reported by Ghon and Roman 1913. Ghon reported the case to the police in 1913. The case was the first of two reported in 1913 and 1914. The second was reported in 1914 and was reported to police in 1915.
