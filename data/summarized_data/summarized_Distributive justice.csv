Distributive justice,"Distributive justice concerns the socially just allocation of resources in a society. It is concerned with how to allocate resources fairly among members of a society taking into account factors such as wealth income and social status. This subject has been given considerable attention in philosophy and the social sciences. Distributive justice is the arrangement of social political and economic institutions to promote the just distribution of benefits and burdens within a society. Most contemporary theories of distributive justice rest on the precondition of material scarcity. From that preconditions arises the need for principles to resolve competing interest and claims concerning a just or at least morally preferable distribution of scarce resources. Distributive justice is perceived fairness of how rewards and costs are shared by distributed across group members. When some workers work more hours but receive the same pay group members may feel that distributive justice has not occurred. Individuals often turn to the behavioral expectations of their group to determine whether justice has taken place. Five types of distributive norms are defined by Donelson R Forsyth. Equality Regardless of their inputs all group members should be given an equal share of the rewardscosts Equality supports that someone who contributes 20 of the groups resources should receive as much as someone who contribute 60. Large groups prefer to base allocations of rewards and costs on equity. Those with more authority status or control over the group should receive more than those in lower level positions. Those in greatest needs should be provided with resources needed to meet those needs. These individuals should be given more resources than those who already possess them. Theories of distributive justice are some of the most prominent theories within the field. John Rawls outlines his famous theory about justice as fairness in his book A Theory of Justice. Theory consists of three core components the equality of people in rights and liberties. The equality of opportunities for those who have less to share their resources. Rawls bases his work on an idea of justice being rooted in the basic structure constituting the fundamental rules in society. This basic structure is what shapes the citizens life opportunities. According to Rawls the structure is based on principles such as benefit maximisation for those who are least advantaged. The original position Rawls presents the concept of an original position as a hypothetical idea of how to establish a fair procedure. In his envisioning of the original position it is created from a judgement made through negotiations between a group of people who will decide on what a just distribution would be. According to Rawls the primary goods include freedoms opportunities and control over resources. These people are assumed to be guided by selfinterest while also having a basic idea of morality and justice. Rawls then argues that procedural justice in the process of negotiation will be possible via a nullification of temptations for these people to exploit circumstances. This nullification of temptations is realised through a veil of ignorance which these people will be behind. The veil prevents the people from knowing what particular preferences they will have by concealing their talents objectives and most importantly where in society they themselves will end up. Negotiations will be sensitive to both those who are worst off and the rest of society. The risk of being in that category yourself will incentivize protection of these people. An environment for negotiations where the evaluation of the distribution of goods is based on general considerations regardless of place. Rawls theorizes two basic principles of just distribution. The first principle the liberty principle is the equal access to basic rights and liberties for all. With this each person should be able to access the most extensive set of set of rights. case you would end up in higher classes.  Rawls argues that such distribution should be based on a reasonable expectation of advantage for all. Thereby it is not only a question of positive individual access but also of negative restrictions so as to respect others basic rights and liberties. The second principle the difference principle addresses how the arrangement of social and economic inequalities should look. Jeremy Bentham published his book An Introduction to the Principles of Morals and Legislation in 1789. Centred on individual utility and welfare utilitarianism builds on the notion that any action which increases the overall welfare in society is good. These principles of justice are then prioritised according to two additional principles Utilitarianism.  utilitarianism is a school of thought that focuses on utilisation maximisation. A major dispute within the school of utilitarianism revolved around the conceptualisation and measurement of welfare. With disputes over this utilitarianism has come to be seen as a theory of justice.  utilitarianism is evidently a broad term embracing many different subtheories under its umbrella. Bentham originally conceptualised this according to the hedonistic calculus which also became the foundation for John Stuart Mills focus on intellectual focus. Much of the theoretical framework transects across these conceptualisations using the different conceptualisation. Aristotle attempted to create a more universal list of conditions required for human prosperity. Another path focuses on a subjective evaluation of happiness and satisfaction in human lives. Based on a fundamental notion of equal worth and moral status of human beings egalitarianism is concerned with equal treatment of all citizens. Egalitarianism evaluates the justification for a certain distribution based on how the society and its institutions have been shaped. Attention is mainly given to ways in which unchosen person circumstances affect and hinder individuals and their life opportunities. The positive aim of egalitarian justice isto create a positive. relation to the state as well as one another.  egalitarianism for instance requires the equal allocation of material resources to every person of a given society. The principle of strict equality therefore holds that even if an unequal distribution would make. community in which people stand in relation of equality to others, it should still be pursued. The Pareto norm suggests that principles of distributive justice should result in allocations in which it is no longer possible to make anyone better off without making anyone else worse off. This illustrates a concern for the equality of everyone. If an unequal distribution would make some better off but no one worse off the strictly egalitarian distribution should be upheld. Roland Pierik presents a synthesis combining luck egalitarianism and social egalitarianism. In his synthesis he argues that ex ante equality is equality in peoples prospects which is captured by alternative conceptions of equality such as those that demand equality of opportunity. He also argues that welfare is an ex post conception of equality as it is concerned with the equality in outcomes.  egalitarianism scholars should instead given the fundamental notion upon which the theory is built strive to create institutions that creates and promotes meaningful equal opportunities. Pierik thus moves egalitarianisms otherwise reactive nature by emphasising a need for attention to the development of fundamentally different institutions that would eradicate the need for redistribution.  distributive justice refers to the initial equal distribution of opportunities from which people can shape their lives. In Marxism according to Karl Marx the slogan He who does not work neither shall he eat is a necessary approach to Distributive justice on the path towards a communist society. The slogan From each according to his ability to eachaccording to his needs refers toributive justice in Marxism. OCBs are employee actions in support of the organization that are outside the scope of their job description. Such behaviors depend on the degree to which an organization is perceived to be distributively just. As organizational actions and decisions are perceived as more just employees are more likely to engage in OCBs. Distributive justice considers whether the distribution of goods among the members of society at a given time is subjectively acceptable. Not all advocates of consequentialist theories are concerned with an equitable society. What unites them is the mutual interest in achieving the best possible results.  Distributive justice in an environmental context is the equitable distribution of a societys technological and environmental risks impacts and benefits. These burdens include exposure to hazardous waste land appropriation armed violence and murder. There is evidence that shows that these burdens cause health problems and negatively affect quality of life.  Distributive justice theory argues that societies have a duty to individuals in need. Proponents of distributive justice link it to human rights. Many governments are known for environmental degradation and regulatory policies. Environmental burdens fall disproportionately upon the Global South while benefits are primarily accrued to the Global North. Distributive justice is also fundamental to the Catholic Churchs social teaching inspiring such figures as Dorothy Day and Pope John Paul II Criticism Friedrich von Hayek within the context of Western liberal liberal democracy. dealing with issues of distributive justice especially in countries with ethnic tensions and geographically distinctive minorities Postapartheid South Africa is an example of a country that deals with issues. Friedrich von Hayek was one of the most famous opposers of the idea of distributive justice. For Hayek social justice was meaningless and impossible to attain on the grounds of being within a system where outcomes are not determined deliberately by the people but contrarily spontaneity is the norm. Hayek: Some minimum of food shelter and clothing sufficient to preserve health and the capacity to work can be assured to everybody. Providing this. in this sense incompatible with that system. in his book The Road to Serfdom there can be found considerations about social assistance from the state. Hayek: Security is for Hayek compatible with individual freedom as it does not involve planning. But he acknowledges that this provision must keep the incentives and the external pressure going. Under these conditions the striving for security tends to become higher than the love of freedom. Hayek dismisses an organizational view that ascribes certain outcomes to an intentional design which would be contrary to his proposed spontaneous order. He concludes that adequate security against severe privation and the reduction of the avoidable causes of misdirected effort will have to be one of the main goals of policy. Justice has an individual component for Hayek is only understood in the aggregation of individual actions which follow common rules. Social and distributive justice are the negative opposite as they need a command economy. Justice as meaningless when it is applied to the results of a liberal market system that should yield spontaneous outcomes. Hayek's third critique is about the unfeasibility of attaining distributive justice in a free market order. In a catallactic order the individual morality should freely determine what are distributive fairness and the values that govern economic activity. It is impossible to gather all the individual information in a single pursuit for survival. Hayek claims for the incompatibility between the free market and social justice. The former is one determined by the interaction of free individuals and the latter by the decision of an authority. social and distributive justice results in realizing the fact that it cannot be pursued.  Lockean selfownership implies labor mixed with the world or others who give to him in exchange for something or as a gift. For him there is no more a distributing or distribution of shares than there is a distribution of mates in a society in which persons choose. The market and the result of individual actions provided the conditions for libertarian principles of just acquisition and exchange contained in his Entitlement Theory. This means that there can be no pattern to which to conform or aim. The market will provide a distribution that will be just without the need for considerations about the specific model or standard it should follow."
