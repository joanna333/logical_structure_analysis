Anatomical terms of bone,"Many anatomical terms descriptive of bone are defined in anatomical terminology and are often derived from Greek and Latin. Bone in the human body is categorized into long bone short bone flat bone irregular bone and sesamoid bone. Long bones are found in the arms humerus ulna radius and legs femur tibia fibula. A short bone is one that is cubelike in shape being approximately equal in length width and thickness. Long bones function as levers they move when muscles contract. Short bones provide stability and support as well as some limited motion. Flat bones are something of a misnomer because although a flat bone is a short bone, it is not flat.  Flat bones serve as points of attachment for muscles and often protect internal organs. Flat bones do not have a medullary cavity because they are thin. An irregular bone is one that does not have an easily classified shape and defies description. A sesamoid bone is a small round bone that as the name suggests is shaped like a sesame seed. These bones form in tendons the sheaths of tissue that connect bones to muscles where a great deal of pressure is generated in a joint. The only type of sesamoid bone that is common to everybody is the kneecap patella pl patellae. are typically found in tendons associated with the feet hands and knees. A condyle is the round prominence at the end of a bone most often part of a joint an articulation with another bone. Tubercle and tuberosity refer to a projection or bump with a roughened surface with a tubercle generally smaller than a tuberosity. A process refers to a relatively large projection or prominent bump as does a promontory. The word ramus refers to a bone such as the ramus of the mandible in the jaw or superior pubic ramus Ramus may also be used to refer to nerves such as ramus communicans. The word ridge is derived from Old English. Malleolus Latin small hammer is the bony prominence on each side of the ankle. Each leg is supported by two bones the tibia on the inner side medial of the leg and the fibula on the outer side lateral. These are known as the medial and lateral malleolu.  trochanters are parts of the femur to which muscles attach. It may refer to the greater lesser or third trochanter Cavities Openings The following terms are used to describe cavities that connect to other areas A foramen is any opening particularly referring to those in bone. The following terms are used to describe cavities that do not connect to other areas. A canal is a long tunnellike foramen usually a passage for notable nerves or blood vessels. A fossa is a depression or hollow usually in a bone such as the hypophyseal fossa the depression in the sphenoid bone A fovea Latin pit is a small pit usually on the head of a bone. A sinus refers to a bony cavity usually within the skull. A joint or articulation is the region where adjacent bones contact each. A labyrinth refers to the bony labyrinth and membranous labyrinth components of the inner ear. Bones are commonly described with the terms head neck shaft body and base. Terms that refer to joints include articular process referring to a projection that contacts an adjacent bone suture referring to an articulation between cranial bones. other for example the elbow shoulder or costovertebral joint. The end of the long bone opposite to the head is known as the base. The cortex of a bone is used to refer to its outer layers and medulla used to referring to the inner surface of the bone. Red marrow in which blood is formed is present in spongy bone as well as in the medullary cavity."
