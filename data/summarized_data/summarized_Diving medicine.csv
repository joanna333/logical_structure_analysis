Diving medicine,"Diving medicine also called undersea and hyperbaric medicine UHB is the diagnosis treatment and prevention of conditions caused by humans entering the undersea environment. Diving medical practitioners are also expected to be competent in the examination of divers and potential divers to determine fitness to dive. Diving medicine deals with medical research on issues of diving. Hyperbaric medicine is a corollary field associated with diving since recompression in a hyperbaric chamber is used as a treatment for two of the most significant divingrelated illnesses decompression sickness and arterial gas embolism. Diving medicine is a branch of occupational medicine and sports medicine and at first aid level an important part of diver education. The scope of diving medicine must necessarily include conditions that are specifically connected with the diving. relationship between the state of physical and psychological health of the diver and safety.  conditions associated with exposure to variations of ambient pressure. These conditions are largely shared by aviation and space medicine. Conditions associated with diving and other aquatic and outdoor activities are commonly included in books which are aimed at the diver. These include deep water blackout isobaric counterdiffusion and high pressure nervous syndrome. The scope of knowledge necessary for a practitioner of diving medicine includes the medical conditions associated with diving and their treatment physics and physiology relating to the underwater and pressurised environment. The standard operating procedures and equipment used by divers can influence the development and management of these conditions. The ECHMEDTC Educational and Training Standards for Diving and Hyperbaric Medicine 2011 specify the following scope of knowledge for diving and hyperbaric medicine. Diving medicine includes the following: Physiology and pathology of diving andHyperbaric exposure HBOBasics effects of diving. Chamber technique multiplace monoplace transport chambers wet recompression Mandatory indications HBO Recommended indications HBO Experimental and anecdotal indications HBO Data collection statistics evaluation HBO General basic treatment nursing HBO Diagnostic monitoring and therapeutic devices in chambers. Risk assessment incidents monitoring and safety plan in HBO chambers HBO Safety regulations. Divers have to breathe a gas which is at the same pressure as their surroundings which can be much greater than on the surface. ambient pressure underwater increases by 1 standard atmosphere 100 kPa for every 10 metres 33 ft of depth. The principal conditions are decompression illness which covers decompression sickness and arterial gas embolism. Divers will often breathe a gas mixture different from air to mitigate these effects. Nitrox which contains more oxygen and less nitrogen is commonly used as a breathing gas to reduce the risk of decompression sickness at recreational depths up to about 40 metres. Helium may be added to.  reduce the amount of nitrogen and oxygen in the gas mixture when diving deeper to reduce the effects of narcosis. This is complicated at depths beyond about 150 metres 500 ft because a heliumoxygen mixture heliox then causes high pressure nervous syndrome. More exotic mixtures such as hydreliox are used at extreme depths to counteract this. Bubbles form as the pressure is reduced on ascent from a dive. The results may range from pain in the joints where the bubbles form to blockage of an artery leading to damage to the nervous system paralysis or death. While bubbles can form anywhere in the body DCS is most frequently observed in the shoulders. Pulmonary DCS is very rare in divers. 10 to 15 of cases Pulmonary barotrauma and arterial gas embolism are very rare. AGE has effects similar to severe decompression sickness. Gas bubbles within the arterial circulation can block the supply of blood to the body. Nitrogen narcosis is caused by the pressure of dissolved gas in the body and produces temporary impairment to the nervous system. It can also decrease motor skills and worsen performance in tasks requiring manual dexterity. As depth increases so does the pressure and hence the. Helium is the least narcotic of all gases and divers may use breathing mixtures containing a proportion of it. The effects may vary widely from individual to individual and from day to day for the same diver. The narcotic effects dissipate without lasting effect as the pressure decreases during ascent.  helium for dives exceeding about 40 metres 130 ft deep. In the 1960s it was expected that helium narcosis would begin to become apparent at depths of 300 metres 1000 ft However it was found that different symptoms such as tremors occurred at shallower depths around 150 metres 500 ft. This became known as highpressure nervous syndrome. The lungs and brain are particularly affected by high partial pressures of oxygen such as are encountered in diving. Although oxygen is essential to life in concentrations significantly greater than normal it becomes toxic overcoming the bodys natural defences antioxidants and causing cell death in any part of the body. Susceptibility to oxygen toxicity varies dramatically from person to person. Most dangerous effect of oxygen toxicity is a convulsion resembling an epileptic seizure. Prior to convulsion several symptoms may be present most distinctly that of an aura Treatments Treatment of diving disorders depends on the specific disorder or combination of disorders. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy is the definitive treatment for most conditions of decompression illness. The administration of oxygen as a medical intervention is common in diving medicine both for first aid and for longer term. and definitive treatment where diving is involved. First aid oxygen administration at high concentration which is seldom contraindicated. Normobaric oxygen administration at the highest available concentration is frequently used as first aid for any diving injury. There is epidemiological support for its use from a statistical study of cases recorded in a long term database. Recompression treatment in a hyperbaric chamber was initially used as a lifesaving tool to treat decompression sickness in caisson workers and divers.  Hyperbaric oxygen treatment is generally preferred when effective as it is usually a more efficient and lower risk method of reducing symptoms of decompression illness. In some cases recompression to pressures where oxygen toxicity is unacceptable may be required to treat decompression sickness. Fitness to dive or medical fitness to dive is the medical and physical suitability of a person to function safely in the underwater environment. Some countries have no facilities at all and in others which have facilities such as the US some hospitals do not make them available for emergency treatment. The most important medical examination is the one before starting a dive. A medical examination by a physician registered as a medical examiner of divers following a procedural checklist and a legal document of fitness to dive issued by the medical examiner. procedures Depending on the circumstances it may be established by a signed statement by the diver that he or she does not suffer from any of the listed disqualifying conditions. Psychological factors can affect fitness to dive particularly where they affect response to emergencies or risk taking behaviour. The use of medical and recreational drugs can also influence fitness to Dive. diving as the diver can be screened to prevent exposure when a dangerous condition exists.  prescription drug use may have a net positive effect when effectively treating an underlying condition. Side effects of effective medication may have undesirable influences on the fitness of diver. Most cases of recreational drug use result in an impaired fitness to dive and a significantly increased risk of suboptimal response to emergencies. Specialist training in underwater and. both for physiological and behavioural reasons. The NOAAUHMS Physicians Training Course in Diving Medicine has been presented since 1977. The course is designed for qualified hyperbaric medicine practitioners. It is available from several institutions and registration is possible with professional associations and governmental registries. The course is to train physicians to recognize and treat diving medical emergencies. It is intended for medical practitioners but may be useful to others who work in the field of diving safety and operations. Subject matter includes Basic physics and physiology of the hyperbaric environment. Diving theory, diving computer theories and types and comparison to dive tables. The clinical application of hyperbaric oxygen therapy and the clinical application to decompression sickness. Commercial diving compared to recreational and technical diving including differences in procedures equipment and diver categories. Divingrelated conditions resulting from the effects of longterm effects of diving flying after diving altitude thermal conditions age and gender Neurologic assessment on a diver with signs andor symptoms of DCI Medical and fitness standards for diving including contraindications for both commercial and recreational diving. ACGME and the American Osteopathic Association AOA offer 12month programs in undersea and hyperbaric medicine associated with ACGME or AOA. The Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education offers the programs. The programs are designed to prepare divers for diving in an occupational setting. European Committee for Hyperbaric Medicine and European Diving Technical Committee defines job descriptions for several levels of diving and hyperbaric physician. AOA accredited programs in emergency medicine family medicine internal medicine occupational medicine preventive medicine or anesthesiology ECHMEDTC Educational and Training Standards. Med must be competent to perform the assessments of medical fitness to dive of occupational and recreational divers and compressed air workers. Certificates of competence may be issued by a nationally accredited institution or an internationally acknowledged agency and periodic recertification is required. A DMP must be competent to perform the initial and all other assessments of medical fitness to dive of working and recreational divers or compressed air workers. A DMP should have knowledge in relevant aspects of occupational health but is not required to be a certified. A DMP should have certified skills and basic practical experience in assessment of medical fitness to dive management of diving accidents. Level 2H Hyperbaric Medicine Physician HMP minimum 120 teaching hours. An HMP will be responsible for hyperbaric treatment sessions. An HMP must be competent to assess and manage clinical patients for hyperbaric oxygen therapy treatment. HMP is not required to be a certified specialist in anaesthesia and intensive care. Level 3 Hyperbaric medicine expert is a physician who has been assessed as competent to manage a HBO centre. Gesellschaft für Tauch und Überdruckmedizin e V Society for Diving and Hyperbaric medicine. manage research programs on diving medicine. supervise a team of HBO doctors and personnel health professionals. teach relevant aspects of hyperbaric Medicine and physiology. Swiss standards for education and assessment of diving medical practitioners are controlled by the Schweizerische Gesellschaft für Unterwasser und Hyperbarmedizin. They include Medical Examiner of Divers Diving Medicine Physician and Hyperbaric Medicine Consultant. Austrian standards for education and assessment of diving medical practitioners are controlled by the Österreichische Gesellschaft für Tauch und Hyperbarmedizin. They include Medical Examiner of Divers and Chief Hyperbaric Medicine Physician. The South African Department of Employment and Labour registers two levels of Diving Medical Practitioner. Level 1 is qualified to conduct annual examinations and certification of medical fitness to dive on commercial divers equivalent to ECHMEDTC Level 1 Medical Examiner of Divers. Level 2 isqualified to provide medical advice to a diving contractor and hyperbaric. Physician Australia has a four tier system. Treatment for diving injuries is equivalent to ECHMEDTC Level 2D Diving Medicine. GPs completing the first tier four to fiveday course on how to examine divers for fitness to dive can then add their names to the SPUMS Diving Doctors List. The candidate must attend a twoweek course write a dissertation related to DHM and have the equivalent of six months fulltime experience working in a hyperbaric medicine unit. The fourth tier is the Certificate in Diving and Hyperbaric Medicine from the ANZ College of Anaesthetists. First aid treatment of diving related disorders is part of the basic training for most recreational and professional divers. A recreational diver has the same duty of care to other divers as any ordinary member of the public and therefore there is no obligation to train recreational divers in first aid. First aid training is recommended by most if not all recreational diver training agencies. Recreational diving instructors and divemasters on the other hand are to a greater or lesser extent responsible for the safety of divers under their guidance. They are generally required to be trained and certified to some level of rescue and first aid competence. Professional divers are expected to act as standby divers for other members of the team. The duties of a standby diver include rescue attempts if the working diver gets into difficulties. Professional divers are generally required to be trained in rescue procedures appropriate for diving accidents. Diving supervisors have a similar duty of care and are responsible for operational planning and safety. They are also expected to manage emergency procedures including the first aid that may be required. The level of first aid training competence and registration varies and may be specified by state or national legislation. In South Africa registered commercial and scientific divers must hold current certification in first aid at the national Level 1 with additional training in oxygen administration for diving accidents. registered diving supervisors must hold Level 2 first aid certification. Offshore diving contractors frequently follow the IMCA recommendations. certification will generally take this into account. A diver medic recognised by IMCA must be capable of administering first aid and emergency treatment. The medic must also be able to assist the diving supervisor with decompression procedures and provide treatment in a hyperbaric chamber in an emergency. The diver medic must hold at a minimum a valid certificate of medical fitness to operate in a pressurized environment. Experimental work on human subjects is often ethically andor legally impracticable Tests where the endpoint is symptomatic decompression sickness are difficult to authorise. Training standards for diver medic are described in the IMCA Scheme for Recognition of Diver Medic Training.  privacy concerns prevent a large mount of information potentially useful to the general diving population from being made available to researchers. allowing a realistic assessment of risk. Analysis of investigations into accidents is useful when reliable results are available which is less often than would be desirable.
