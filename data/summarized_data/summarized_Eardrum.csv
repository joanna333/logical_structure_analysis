Eardrum,The eardrum is a thin coneshaped membrane that separates the external ear from the middle ear. Its function is to transmit changes in pressure of sound from the air to the ossicles inside themiddle ear and thence to the oval window in the fluidfilled cochlea. The tympanic membrane is oriented obliquely in the anteroposterior mediolateral and superoinferior planes. It relates superiorly to the middle cranial fossa posterior to the ossicles and facial nerve. Rupture of the eardrum can lead to conductive hearing loss. The eardrum is divided into two general regions the pars flaccida and the pars tensa. The relatively fragile pars Flaccida lies above the lateral process of the malleus between the Notch of Rivinus and the anterior and posterior malleal folds. The larger pars Tensa consists of three layers skin skin. The middle fibrous layer containing radial circular and parabolic fibers encloses the handle of malleus. Though comparatively robust the pars tensa is the region more commonly associated with perforations. The manubrium Latin for handle of themalleus is firmly attached to the medial surface of the membrane. The lateral surface of the membrane is thus concave. as far as its center drawing it toward the tympanic cavity. The most depressed aspect of this concavity is termed the umbo Latin for shield boss Nerve supply Sensation of the outer surface is supplied mainly by the auriculotemporal nerve. The inner surface of the tympanic membrane is innervated by the glossopharyngeal nerve. When the eardrum is illuminated during a medical examination a cone of light radiates from the tip of the malleus to the periphery in the anteroinferior quadrant. Eustachian tube dysfunction prevents equalization of pressure in the middle ear. It is also known to occur in swimming diving including scuba diving and martial arts. Patients with tympanic membrane rupture may experience bleeding tinnitus hearing loss or disequilibrium vertigo. A myringotomy is a surgical procedure in which a tiny incision is created in the eardrum to relieve pressure caused by excessive buildup of fluid or to drain pus. for treatment of middle ear infections. In some cases the pressure of fluid in an infected middle ear is great enough to cause the earrum to rupture naturally. Usually this consists of a small hole perforation from which fluid can drain. A tympanostomy tube is inserted into the eardrum to keep the middle ear aerated for a prolonged time and to prevent reaccumulation of fluid. Without the insertion of a tube the incision usually heals spontaneously in two to three weeks. Those requiring myringotomy usually have otitis media which is a common problem in children. Myringotomy without tube placement was also used as a major treatment of severe acute otitis media. The Bajau people of the Pacific intentionally rupture their eardrums at an early age to facilitate diving and hunting at sea. Many older Bajas therefore have difficulties hearing.
