Anatomical terminology,"Anatomical terminology is a form of scientific terminology used by anatomists zoologists and health professionals such as doctors. Anatomical terminology uses many unique terms suffixes and prefixes deriving from Ancient Greek and Latin. These terms can be confusing to those unfamiliar with them but can be more precise reducing ambiguity and errors. Also since these anatomical terms are not used in everyday conversation their meanings are less likely to change. An international standard for anatomical terminology Terminologia Anatomica has been created. Anatomical terminology has quite regular morphology the same prefixes and suffixes are used to describe a scar. To illustrate how inexact daytoday language can be a scar above the wrist could be located on the forearm two or three inches away from the hand. The root of a term often refers to an organ or tissue. add meanings to different roots. The first word describes what structure is being spoken about. The second describes an instance of this structure and the third points to its location. When describing the position of anatomical structures structures may be described according to the position. The cephalic region refers to the head. This area is further differentiated into the cranium. The neck area is called the cervix or cervical region. Examples of structures named according to this include. the anatomical landmark they are near These landmarks may include structures such as the umbilicus or sternum. Unique terminology is used to reduce confusion in different parts of the body. For example different terms are used when it comes to the skull in compliance with its embryonic origin and its tilted position compared to in other animals. Similarly different terminology is often used in the arms in part to avoid confusion. Radial refers to the radius bone seen laterally in the standard anatomical position. Ulnar referring to the ulna bone medially positioned when in thestandard anatomical position Other terms are also used to describe the movement and actions of the hands and feet and other structures.  morphological sciences is a biological sciences branch. In this field the form and structure are examined as well as the changes or developments in the organism. It is descriptive and functional Basically it covers the gross anatomy and dentistry and other areas of the health sciences. The vocabulary is extensive varied and complex and requires a systematic presentation. Within the international field a group of experts reviews analyzes and discusses the morphological terms of the structures of the human body forming todays Terminology Committee FICAT from the International Federation of Federation of Anatomy. The current international standard for human anatomical terminology is based on the Terminologia Anatomica TA. In the Latin American field there are meetings called Iberian Latin American Symposium Terminology SILAT where a group of experts of the Pan American Association of Anatomy PAA disseminates and studies the international morphological terminology.  Terminologia Anatomica contains terminology for about 7500 human gross macroscopic anatomical structures. For microanatomy known as histology a similar standard exists. For embryology the study of development a standard exists in Terminologia Embryologica. The Terminologia Anatomica was founded in 1881. It was created to cover the study of histological and embryological structures. As of September 2016 two sections were merged to form the Terminologia Neuroanatomica. Anatomical terminology is often chosen to highlight the relative location of body structures. Anatomical terms used to describe location are based on a body positioned in what is called the standard anatomical position. This position is one in which a person is standing feet apace with palms forward and thumbs facing outwards. The standard body map or anatomical position is that of the body standing upright with the feet at shoulder width and parallel toes forward. The upper limbs are held out to each side and the palms of the hands face forward. In terms of anatomy the body is divided into Regions. In the front the trunk is referred to as the thorax and abdomen. The back as a general area is the dorsum or dorsal area and the lower back is the lumbus or lumbar region. The breast is also called the mammary region and the armpit as the axilla and axillary. The entire arm is referred to as the brachium and brachial. The back of the elbow is called the olecranon. The buttocks are the buttocks. The groin where the thigh joins the trunk are the inguen and inguinal area. Anatomists divide the lower limb into the thigh, the part of the limb between the hip and the knee and the leg. The thigh is the femur and the femoral region. The back of the knee is the popliteus and popliteal area and the pubic area is the pubis. The abdominal cavity can be divided into either nine regions. The calf is the sura and sural region. The ankle is the tarsus and tarsal and the heel is the calcaneus or calcaneal. The foot is the pes and pedal region and the sole is the planta and plantar. The abdomen may be divided into four quadrants more commonly used in medicine subdivides the cavity with one horizontal and one vertical line that intersect at the patients umbilicus navel. The right upper quadrant RUQ includes the lower right ribs right side of the liver and the transverse colon. The left upper quadrants LUQ includes. the lower left ribs stomach spleen and upper left area of the transversal colon. The left lower quadrant LLQ contains the left half of the small intestine and left pelvic bone. The more detailed regional approach subdivides the cavity into nine regions. The vertical or midclavicular lines are drawn as if dropped from the midpoint of each clavicle. The superior horizontal line is the subcostal. The epigastric region is the upper central square and contains the bottom edge of the liver as well as the upper areas of the stomach. line drawn immediately inferior to the ribs. The inferior horizontal line is called the intertubercular line and is to cross iliac tubercles found at the superior aspect of the pelvis. The diaphragm curves like an upside down U over these three regions. The central right region is called the right lumbar region. The umbilical region is central square. The lower right square is the right iliac region and contains the right pelvic region. The hypogastric region is the lower central square and contains the bottom of the pubic bones upper regions of the bladder and the lower region of the small intestine. When anatomists refer to the right and left of the body it is in reference to the the subject not the observer. Body in the anatomical position the left of the body is on the observers right and vice versa. These standardized terms avoid confusion. Examples of terms include 4 Anterior and posterior which describe structures at the front anterior and back posterior. Superior and inferior which describe a position above superior or below inferior another body part. Superficial and deep describe structures that are closer to superficial or farther from deep the surface of the body. Proximal and distal which describe a position that is closer to proximal or farther to distal the trunk of theBody.  medial or lateral describe a position that is closer to medial or farther from lateral the midline of the body. For example the shoulders are lateral to the heart and the umbilicus is medial to the hips. Radial and ulnar describe only structures at or distal to the elbow. Ventral and dorsal describe structures derived from the front ventral and back dorsal of the embryo before limb rotation. Rostral and caudal which describe structures close to rostral or farther from caUDal the nose. same as saying the lateral side the ulnar side of the wrist is the side toward the little finger medial side. For example the eyes are rostrals to the back of the skull and the tailbone is caudals to the chest.  locational terms can define the direction of a vector and pairs of them can define axes that is lines of orientation. For example blood can be said to flow in a proximal or distal direction and anteroposterior mediolateral and inferosuperior axes are lines along which the body moves. An axis can be projected to a corresponding plane. Anatomy is often described in planes referring to twodimensional sections of the body. Three planes are commonly referred to in anatomy and medicine 4. The sagittal plane is the plane that divides the body or an organ vertically. The frontal plane is the plane that divides the body or an organ into an anterior front portion and a posterior rear portion. If this vertical plane runs directly down the middle of the body it is called the midsagittal or median plane. It is often referred to as a coronal plane following Latin corona which means crown. Anastomoses refers to the connection between two structures previously branched out such as blood vessels or leaf veins Patent meaning a structure such as an artery or vein that abnormally remains open such as a patent ductus arteriosus. is the plane that divides the body or organ horizontally into upper and lower portions Transverse planes produce images referred to as cross sections. Patent may also refer to a channel such as a blood vessel section of bowel collecting system or duct that is not occluded and remains open to free flow. Such obstructions may include a calculus ie a kidney stone or gallstone plaque like that encountered in vital arteries.  anatomical variation is used to refer to a difference in anatomical structures that is not regarded as a disorder. Anatomical variation is unlike congenital anomalies which are considered a disorder for example the presence or absence of the palmaris longus tendon. Each movement at a synovial joint results from the contraction or relaxation of the muscles that are attached to the bones on either side of the articulation. The type of movement that can be produced is determined by its structural type. Movement types are generally paired with one being the opposite of the other. Flexion and extension refer to movement that decreases flexion or increases extension the angle between body parts. Abduction and adduction refers to a motion that pulls a structure away from abduction or towards adduction the midline of the body or limb. Internal rotation or medial rotation and external rotation or lateral rotation refers to rotation. Elevation and depression refer to movement in a superior elevation or inferior depression direction. Primarily refers to movements involving the scapula and mandible. Special motions of the hands and feet refer to movements that are regarded as unique to the hands or feet. Palmarflexion and dorsiflexion refer to movement of the flexion of the hand. For example prayer is often conducted with the hands dorsiflexed. Pronation and supination refer to rotation of the forearm or foot so that in the anatomical position the palm or sole is facing anteriorly supination or posteriorly pronation. Eversion and inversion refer to movements that tilt the sole of the foot away from eversion or towards inversion the midline of the body. person is holding a bowl of soup in one hand the hand is supinated and the thumb will point away from the body midline and the palm will be superior if the hands are typing on a computer keyboard they will be pronated with the thumbs toward the bodyMidline. The muscle performing an action is the. insertion of the muscle on respective side. The insertion is on the bone deemed to move towards the origin during muscle contraction. Muscles are often present that engage in several actions of the joint able to perform for example both flexion and extension of the forearm. Muscles that work together to perform the same action are called synergists. The muscle which contraction brings about an opposite action is the antagonist. For example an extension of the lower arm is performed by the triceps and the biceps as the agonist and antagonist.  pennation or lack thereof is an important aspect of gross anatomy of muscles. most important indicator of its role in the body. In most muscles all the fibers are oriented in the same direction running in a line from the origin to the insertion. In pennate muscles the individual fibers areoriented at an angle relative to the line of action. Pennate muscles are usually found where their length change is less important than maximum force such as the rectus femoris. Skeletal muscle is arranged in discrete muscles an example of which is the biceps brachii. The tough fibrous epimysium of skeletal muscle is both connected to and continuous with the tendons. Fibrous layers along with tendons and ligaments constitute the deep fascia of the body. permitting the transfer of force from the muscles to the skeleton. Movement is not limited to only synovial joints although they allow for most freedom. Muscles also run over symphysis which allow for movement in the vertebral column. The body maintains its internal organization by means of membranes sheaths and other structures that separate compartments called body cavities. A serous membrane also referred to as a serosa is a thin membrane that covers the walls of organs in the thoracic and abdominal cavities The serous membranes have two layers parietal and visceral surrounding. The visceral layer of the membrane covers the organ the viscera. The parietal layer lines the walls of the body cavity. Between the parietal and visceral layers is a very thin fluidfilled serous space or cavity. For example the pericardium is the serous cavity which surrounds the heart."
