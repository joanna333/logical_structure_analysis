Drone-Enhanced Emergency Medical Services,Droneenhanced Emergency Medical Services involve the use of highly autonomous Beyond Visual Line of Sight BVLOS drones. DEMS deliver critical medical supplies such as Automated External Defibrillators AEDs lifesaving medications and remote diagnostic equipment directly to emergency situations. The evolution of drone technology in EMS has been fueled by advancements in unmanned aerial systems UAS. Initial trials in the early 2010s laid the groundwork for delivering medical supplies. Pilot programs have focused on specialized applications including rapid delivery of emergency medical equipment and live video feeds. Despite the promising benefits of droneenhanced EMS some challenges remain including public acceptance regulatory hurdles and the technological complexity of integrating these systems into existing emergency response frameworks. As healthcare organizations seek innovative solutions to improve emergency medical responses addressing these challenges will be crucial. The use of drones for healthcare logistics can be traced back to early trials in the 2010s. Early trials focused on delivering medical supplies to remote areas aiming to address logistical challenges such as extreme weather conditions. The use of drone technology has led to a broader range of use cases including EMS.  EMS began to explore more specialized applications by the mid2010s. Pilot programs were developed to test drones for the delivery of critical medical supplies such as Automated External Defibrillators AEDs. These early implementations demonstrated the potential for drones to significantly improve medical delivery efficiency. Drones are increasingly being integrated into EMS with applications ranging from rapid assessment of emergency situations to delivering medical supplies like AEDs and medical supplies. The potential of drone technology continues to expand as regulatory oversight continues to increase. for outofhospital cardiac arrest cases. DEMS leverages advancements in unmanned aerial systems UAS enabling the rapid and autonomous delivery of medical supplies to incident sites before regular units arrive on scene. These drones operate Beyond Visual Line of Sight BVLOS allowing them to respond faster cover greater distances. Drones used in DEMS are often modified to meet healthcarespecific requirements. These adaptations ensure that sensitive medical materials can be delivered safely and effectively in an emergency. Despite their effectiveness drones face several operational challenges. Factors such as weather conditions battery life and data transmission capabilities. Drones used in DEMS are often equipped with highdefinition cameras and. Realtime data transmission. payload capacity can limit the performance of drones in emergency medical applications. However ongoing advancements in drone technology aim to overcome these limitations. Some of these innovations include more efficient batteries and better obstacle detection systems. Sensors providing live video feeds and biometric data to emergency responders. This allows healthcare professionals to assess the situation remotely and guide onsite interventions before physical responders arrive. Drones are being used in the rapid transportation of medical supplies in emergencies. For example healthcare drones have been adapted to carry critical items such as defibrillators. AEDequipped drones can reduce response times compared to traditional ground transportation. This reduction in time is crucial for improving patient outcomes particularly in cardiac arrest cases where immediate defibrillation can save lives. Drones have. which can make a significant difference in emergency response scenarios. Drones are also being used to support telemedicine and remote patient monitoring. By transmitting realtime video feeds and biometric data from delivered devices enables healthcare. also been used in disaster relief where they can rapidly deliver medical supplies to hardtoreach areas. Drone trials have evaluated the effectiveness of drones delivering AEDs in reallife cardiac arrest situations. Swedish study in 20202023 reported that drones arrived before ambulances in 57 of cases. Drones were attached by bystanders in 35 of these cases. These drones are particularly useful in areas with limited healthcare resources. Reallife. achieved a 92 success rate in delivering AEDs within 9 meters of the target. The reallife case study published in the New England Journal of Medicine showed that a dronedelivered AED was successfully used to defibrillate a cardiac arrest patient before emergency medical services arrived.
