Criminology,"Criminology is a multidisciplinary field in both the behavioural and social sciences. It draws primarily upon the research of sociologists political scientists economists legal sociologist psychologists philosophers psychiatrists social workers biologists social anthropologists scholars of law and jurisprudence as well as the processes that lead to crime. The interests of criminologists include the study of nature of crime and criminals origins of criminal law etiology of crime social reaction to crime and the functioning of law enforcement agencies and the penal institutions. define administration of justice and the criminal justice system. Criminology studies the control of crime and the rehabilitation of offenders. Modern academic criminology has direct roots in the 19thcentury Italian School of criminal anthropology. It includes within its scope the activities of legislative bodies, judicial institutions and correctional institutions. The term criminology was most likely coined in 1885 by Italian law professor Raffaele Garofalo as Criminologia. Gibson caused a radical refocusing of criminological discussion throughout Europe and the United States from law to the criminal. Criminology grew substantially as a discipline in the first quarter of the twentieth century. From 1900 through to 2000 this field of research underwent three significant phases in the United States. The Golden Age of Research 19001930 has been described as a multiplefactor approach. The 19602000 period was seen as a significant period in criminological research. There were three main schools of thought in early criminological theory spanning the period from the mid18th century to the midtwentieth century Classical Positivist and Chicago. These schools were superseded by several contemporary paradigms of criminology such as the subculture control strain.  Classical school arose in the mid18th century and reflects ideas from utilitarian philosophy Cesare Beccaria author of On Crimes and Punishments 176364 Jeremy Bentham inventor of the panopticon and other early criminological philosophers proposed ideas including Punishment should be used to deter people from further criminal action. The Positivist school argues criminal behaviour comes from actual harms not intent. This school developed during a major reform in penology when society began designing prisons for the sake of extreme punishment. This period also saw many legal reforms the French Revolution and the development of the legal system in the United States. Positivism is the school of thought that criminals are born as criminals and not made into them. They argue that criminal behavior is innate and within a person. Positivism comprises three segments biological psychological and social positivism Psychological Positivist. Sociological Positivism is the school of thought that criminals are produced by society. This school claims that low income levels high povertyunemployment rates and poor educational systems create and motivate criminals. The notion of having a criminal personality is achieved from the thought of psychological positivism. There is evidence of correlation but not causation between these personality traits and criminal actions. Cesare Lombroso 18351909 an Italian sociologist working in the late 19th century is often called the father of criminology. He was one of the key contributors to biological. positivism. Lombroso took a scientific approach insisting on empirical evidence for studying crime. He suggested physiological traits such as the measurements of cheekbones or hairline could indicate atavistic criminal tendencies. This approach whose influence came via the theory of phrenology and by Charles Darwins theory of evolution has been superseded. Sociological positivism suggests societal factors such as poverty membership of subcultures or low levels of education can predispose people to crime. Adolphe Quetelet used data and statistical analysis to study the relationship between crime and society. Lance Lochner performed three different research experiments each one proving education reduces crime. Henry Mayhew used empirical. sociological factors. He found age gender poverty education and alcohol consumption were important factors to crime. Rawson W Rawson used crime statistics to suggest a link between population density and crime rates.  Ã‰mile Durkheim viewed crime as an inevitable aspect of a society with uneven distribution of wealth and other differences among people Differential association subcultural posits that people learn crime through association. This theory was advocated by Edwin Sutherland who focused on how a person becomes delinquent because of an excess of excess of wealth. Criminal subcultures are a major cause of delinquency. The Chicago school arose because of the subculture of criminal behavior. The school taught students how to avoid committing a crime by choosing the right definition of a crime over the wrong one. The Chicago School was a school of urban sociologists at the University of Chicago in the early twentieth century. In the 1920s Park and Burgess identified five concentric zones that often exist as cities grow including the zone of transition which was identified as the most volatile and subject to disorder. Henry McKay and Clifford R Shaw focused on juvenile delinquents in the 1940s. Chicago school sociologists adopted a social ecology approach to criminology. thought developed that blames social structures for human behaviors. The defense and argument lies in the thoughts that these people and their acts are not their faults but they are actually the result of society. Urban neighborhoods with high levels of poverty often experience a breakdown in the social structure and institutions such as family and schools. This results in social disorganization which reduces the ability of these institutions to control behavior and creates an environment ripe for deviant behavior. Edwin Sutherland suggested that people learn criminal behavior from older more experienced criminals with more experience. Theoretical perspectives used in criminology include psychoanalysis functionalism interactionism Marxism econometrics systems theory postmodernism behavioural genetics personality psychology evolutionary psychology etc Social structure theories. This theory is applied to a variety of approaches within the bases of crim in particular and in sociology more generally. Social disorganization theory postulates that neighborhoods plagued with poverty and economic deprivation tend to experience high rates of population turnover. This theory suggests that crime and deviance is valued within groups in society subcultures or gangs. These groups have different values to the social norm. Since the 1950s social ecology studies have built on the social disorganization theories. Many studies have found that crime rates are associated with poverty disorder. neighborhoods also tend to have high population heterogeneity. With high turnover informal social structure often fails to develop which in turn makes it difficult to maintain social order. Poverty concentration effect may cause neighborhoods to be isolated from the mainstream of society and become prone to violence. Strain Strain theory also known as Mertonian Anomie advanced by American sociologist Robert Merton suggests that mainstream culture especially in the United States is saturated with dreams of opportunity freedom and prosperity. Merton also used the term anomie but it meant something slightly different for him than it did for Durkheim. Merton saw the term as meaning a dichotomy between what society expected of its citizens and what those citizens could actually achieve. Robert Agnew developed this theory further to include types of strain which were not derived from financial constraints. This is known as general strain theory Subcultural theorists focused on small cultural groups fragmenting away from the mainstream. Others will retreat or drop out into deviant subcultures such as gang members or hobos. Albert K Cohen tied anomie theory with Sigmund Freuds reaction formation idea suggesting that delinquency among lowerclass youths is a reaction against the social norms of the middle class. Some youth especially from poorer areas where opportunities are scarce might adopt social norms specific to those places that may include toughness and disrespect for authority. Delinquency tends to occur among the lowerworkingclass males who have a lack of resources available to them and live in impoverished areas. Such youths may be tempted to take up criminal activities choosing an illegitimate path that provides them more lucrative economic benefits than conventional over legal options. Bias has been known to occur among law enforcement agencies. Officers tend to place a bias on minority groups without knowing for sure if they had committed a crime or not. British subcultural theorists focused more heavily on the issue of class where some criminal activities were seen as imaginary solutions to the problem of belonging to a subordinate class. Sociologists have explored the impact of a Southern culture of honor on violent crime rates. Social bond or social control theory tries to explain why people do not become criminal. Travis Hirschi identified four main characteristics attachment to others belief in moral validity of rules commitment to achievement and involvement in conventional activities. Criminology theories do not look at why people commit crime but rather why they do not commit crime. more a person features those characteristics the less likely he or she is to become deviant or criminal. On the other hand if these factors are not present a person is more likely to become a criminal. Hirschi expanded on this theory with the idea that a person with low selfcontrol is morelikely to become criminal. If the person cannot exert selfcontrol he or she might try to get the yacht or the means for it in an illegal way. Someone with high selfcontrol will more likely either wait deny themselves of what want or seek an intelligent intermediate solution such as joining a yacht club to use a yacht. Psychoanalytic Psychoanalysis is a psychological theory and therapy which regards the unconscious mind repressed memories and trauma as the key drivers of status. A factor that distinguishes families with delinquent children from those who are not delinquent is the control exerted by parents or chaperonage. Sigmund Freud talks about how the unconscious desire for pain relates to psychoanalysis. Freud suggested that unconscious impulses such as repetition compulsion and a death drive can dominate a persons creativity leading to selfdestructive behavior. Phillida Rosnick posits a difference in the thoughts of individuals suffering traumatic unconscious pain which corresponds to them having deviant behavior. There is enough correlation between this altered state of mind and criminality to suggest causation. Sander Gilman in the article Freud and the Making of Psychoanalysis looks for evidence in the physical mechanisms of the human brain and the nervous system. He suggests there is a direct link between an unconscious desire for pain or punishment and the impulse to commit crime or deviant acts. This school of thought focused on the relationship between state media and conservativeruling elite. draws on the phenomenology of Edmund Husserl and George Herbert Mead as well as subcultural theory and conflict theory. The powerful groups had the ability to become the significant other in the less powerful groups processes of generating meaning. Youngsters would often take the label on board indulge in crime more readily and become actors in the selffulfilling prophecy of the powerful groups. Stanley Cohen developed the concept of moral panic describing the societal reaction to spectacular alarming social phenomena eg AIDS epidemic and football hooliganism. Labeling theory refers to an individual who is labeled by others in a particular way. It was originally derived from sociology but is regularly used in criminological studies. When someone is given the label of a criminal they may reject or accept it and continue to commit crime.  labeling theory can lead to deviancy amplification. Lonnie Athens developed a theory about how brutalization by parents or peers results in violent crimes in adulthood. Malcolm Klein conducted a test which showed that labeling theory affected some youth offenders but not others Traitor theory. Rational choice theory is based on the utilitarian classical school philosophies of Cesare Beccaria. They argued that punishment if certain swift and proportionate to the crime was a deterrent for crime. In Dei delitti e delle pene On Crimes and observations about domestic and societal violence in the criminals backgrounds. Beccaria conceived of punishment as the necessary application of the law for a crime. Beccaria also distinguished between crime and sin and advocated against the death penalty. This philosophy was replaced by the positivist and Chicago schools and was not revived until the 1970s. Rational choice theory argues that criminals like other people weigh costs or risks and benefits when deciding whether to commit crime. They will also try to minimize risks of crime by considering the time place and other situational factors. writings of James Q Wilson. Gary Beckers 1965 article Crime and Punishment and George Stiglers 1970 article The Optimum Enforcement of Laws. Criminals rationally see that the benefits of their crime outweigh the cost such as the probability of apprehension and conviction severity of punishment. From the public policy perspective since the cost of increasing the fine is marginal to that of increasing surveillance one can conclude that the best policy is to maximize the fine and minimize surveillance. Rational choice theories suggest that increasing risk and likelihood of being caught through added surveillance law enforcement presence added street lighting and other measures are effective in reducing crime. to increase the effort required to commit the crime such as target hardening. Bentham considered it possible to completely annihilate crime through the panopticon. Beckers theory acknowledged that a society could not eradicate crime beneath a certain level. For example if 25 of a supermarkets products were stolen it would be very easy to reduce this rate to 15. It would be nearly impossible to reduce it to zero. This reveals that the goals of utilitarianism and classical liberalism have to be tempered. Rational choice theories linked to neoliberalism have been at the basics of crime prevention through environmental design. They underpin the Market Reduction Approach to theft by Mike Sutton which is a systematic toolkit for those seeking to focus attention on crime facilitators. to more modest proposals to be practically applicable. Routine activity theory was expanded by. and Lawrence Cohen. It explains crime in terms of crime opportunities that occur in everyday life. A crime opportunity requires that elements converge in time and place including a motivated offender suitable target or victim and lack of a capable guardian. Biosocial criminology is an interdisciplinary field that aims to explain crime and antisocial behavior by exploring both biological factors and environmental factors. John Eck added a fourth element of place manager such as rental property managers who can take nuisance abatement measures.  evolutionary neuroandrogenic theory seeks to explain why criminality is so much higher in men than in women and why young men are most likely to exhibit criminal behavior. Aggressive behavior has been associated with abnormalities in three principal regulatory systems in the body serotonin systems. In 1968 young British sociologists formed the National Deviance Conference NDC group. The group was restricted to academics and consisted of 300 members. Biosocial approaches remain very controversial within the scientific field of sociology. The NDC rejected previous social approaches.  Marxist criminologists argued against the biological positivism perspective represented by Lombroso Hans Eysenck and Gordon Trasler. According to the Marxist perspective on crime defiance is normal the sense that men are now consciously involved in assuring their human diversity. State crime is a distinct field of crimes that is studied by Marxist criminology which considers these crimes to be some of the most costly to society in terms of overall harminjury. In a Marxist framework genocides environmental degradation and war are not crimes that occur out of contempt for ones fellow man but are crimes of power. Convict criminology is a school of thought in the realm of Criminology. Convict crim inologists have been directly affected by the criminal justice system oftentimes having spent years inside the prison system. Researchers in the field of convict criminologists such as John Irwin and Stephan Richards argue that traditional crim inology can. continue systems of control and hegemony. Queer criminology is a field of study that focuses on LGBT individuals and their interactions with the criminal justice system. Convict Criminology started in the United States after the major expansion of prisons in the 1970s. The US still remains the main focus for those who study convict crim inology. Queer criminology aims to better understand the history of LGBT individuals and the laws put against the community. To conduct research and use it as a form of activism through education. To better understand why LGBT citizens are incarcerated and why they are arrested at higher rates. Some believe that it is not worth researching and not relevant to the field as a whole. It could be argued that this subject is highly valuable in highlighting how LGBT individuals are affected by the criminal justice system. This research also has the opportunity to queer the curriculum of criminology in educational institutions by shifting the focus from controlling and monitoring LGBT people. As more and more people identify as something other than heterosexual queer criminology continues to grow in relevance. In jurisdictions such as Russia Uganda and Ghana governments have become even more punitive through laws that expand the criminalisation of LGBTQ conduct relationships and organising. Digiqueer criminologists aims to deepen understanding of the relationship between digital communities to liberating and protecting them. Cultural criminology views crime and its control within the context of culture. Criminologists can examine the actions of criminals control agents media producers and others to construct the meaning of crime. Cultural Criminology has three tropes village city street, media and males can be geographically influenced by societys views on what is. The village is where one engages in available social activities. Linking the history of an individual to a location can help determine social dynamics. The city street involves positioning oneself in the cultural area. This is full of those affected by poverty poor health and crime. Naegler and Salman believed that Ferrells mold was limited and that they could add to the understanding of cultural criminology by studying women. Hayward would later add that not only feminist theory but green theory as well played a role in the cultural crim inology.  theory through the lens of adrenaline the soft city the transgressive subject and the attentive gaze. The adrenaline lens deals with rational choice and what causes a person to have their own terms of availability opportunity and low levels of social control. The soft city Lens deals with reality outside of the city and the imaginary sense of reality the world where transgression occurs where rigidity is slanted and where rules are bent. The attentive gaze is when someone mainly an ethnographer is immersed into the culture and interested in lifestyles and the symbolic aesthetic and visual aspects. When examined they are left with the knowledge that they are not all the same but come to a settlement of living together in the same space. Through it all sociological perspective on cultural criminology theory attempts to understand how the environment an environment works. Relative deprivation involves the process where an individual measures his or her own wellbeing and materialistic worth against that of other people and perceive that they are worse off in comparison. When humans fail to obtain what they believe they are owed they can experience anger or jealousy over the notion that they have been wrongly disadvantaged.  Relative deprivation can be made up of societal political economic or personal factors which create a sense of injustice. Stouffer revealed that soldiers fighting in World War II measured their personal success by the experience in their units rather than by the standards set by the military.  Relative deprivation theory has increasingly been used to partially explain crime as rising living standards can result in rising crime levels. People who feel jealous and discontent of others might turn to crime to acquire the things that they can not. if a person is financially stable he or she can still feel relatively deprived. The perception of being relatively deprived can lead to criminal behavior and morally problematic decisions. Rural criminology is the study of crime trends outside of metropolitan and suburban areas. Rural criminologists have used social disorganization and routine activity theories. The crime in rural communities consists predominantly of narcotic related crimes such as the production use and trafficking of narcotics. Routine activity theory is used to examine all lowlevel street crimes such as theft. Much of the crime in rural areas is explained through routine activity theory because there is often a lack of capable guardians. examine the trends involving narcotics Social disorganization leads to narcotic use in rural Areas. low educational opportunities and high unemployment rates. Criminologists should be conducting and disseminating research on crime law and deviance in dialogue with affected communities. Public criminology allows criminologists to avoid the constraints of traditional criminological research. In doing so, it allows academics and researchers to provide their research to the public in order to inform public decisions. Public criminology takes on many forms including media and policy advising as well as activism civicoriented education community outreach expert testimony and knowledge coproduction. Both the positivist and classical schools take a consensus view of crime that a crime is an act that violates the basic values and beliefs of society. Natural laws are rooted in core values. Natural laws protect against harm to persons eg murder rape assault or property theft larceny robbery and form the basis of common law systems. Statutes are enacted by legislatures and reflect current cultural mores. Some laws may be controversial eg laws that prohibit cannabis use and gambling Marxist criminology conflict criminologists claim that most relationships between state and citizen are nonconsensual and as such criminal law is not criminal. Rightwing criminologies tend to posit that there is a consensual social contract between state and citizen. There have been moves in contemporary criminological theory to move away from liberal pluralism culturalism and postmodernism. The universal term harm has been introduced as a replacement for the legal term crime. Criminology is the study of the social phenomenon of crime across cultures to identify differences and similarities in crime patterns. Criminology includes Comparative criminology, Penology, Sociology of law, Victimology and Fear of crime."
