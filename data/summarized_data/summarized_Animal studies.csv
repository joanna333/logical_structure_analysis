Animal studies,Animal studies is a recently recognised field in which animals are studied in a variety of crossdisciplinary ways. Scholars who engage in animal studies may be formally trained in a number of diverse fields. They engage with questions about notions of animality animalization or becoming animal to understand humanmade representations of animals. Animal studies seeks to understand both humananimal relations now and in the past as defined by our knowledge of them. Because the field is still developing scholars and others have some freedom to define their own criteria about what issues may structure the field. Animal studies became popular in the 1970s as an interdisciplinary subject. Animal studies is the intersection of a number of different fields of study such as journals and books series etc. Different fields began to turn to animals as an important topic at different times and for various reasons. These separate disciplinary histories shape how scholars approach animal studies. Fewer than 10 of research studies on animals result in new medical findings for human patients. This has led researchers to find new Nonanimal Approach Methodologies. NAMs provide more accurate human reactions to animals for human benefit and so on. Take rats for example with a history of being used as an experimental subject feeder. Peter Singers 1975 work Animal Liberation is a founding document in animal studies. Singers work followed Jeremy Benthams by trying to expand utilitarian questions about pleasure and pain beyond humans to other sentient creatures. The marginal voices help introduce new concepts and ethics that can eventually transform societys relationship with other species. Animal domestication created a new intimate bond between human and nonhuman and changed the way that humans live their lives. Theorists interested in the role of animals in literature culture and Continental philosophy also consider the late work of Jacques Derrida a driving force behind the rise of interest in animal studies. Cary Wolfe published Animal Rites in 2003 and critiqued earlier animal rights philosophers such as Peter Singer and Thomas Regan Wolfes study points out an insidious humanism at play in their philosophies and others. Recently also the Italian philosopher Giorgio Agamben published a book on the question of the animal The Open Man. Namibia has a large collection of ancient rock art from the Stone Age. The skillfully engraved depiction of animal tracks provides important information about the animals of that time. Then in the Middle Ages animals would appear for more religious reasons. Later in the 15th century artists began drawing animals on the walls of caves. During the Renaissance artist Leonardo da Vinci took interest in animal studies. Years later animal representation took the form of woodworking lithography and photographs. In the late 1800s photographers became interested in capturing animal locomotion. Research topics and topics and research topics. coinciding with animals. Researchers in animal studies examine the questions and issues that arise when traditional modes of humanistic and scientific inquiry begin to take animals seriously. Students of animal studies may examine how humanity is defined in relation to animals or how representations of animals create understandings and misunderstandings of other species. People with animal phobias tend to negatively generalize animals even species that are harmless. In most movies predatory animals such as sharks and wolves are usually the antagonists. This only causes significant damage to their reputation and makes people fear what they think their true nature is. Researchers are analyzing the positive and negative effects of anthropomorphized animals on a childs view of the nonhuman species. Donna Haraways book Primate Visions examines how dioramas created for the American Museum of Natural History showed family groupings that conformed to the traditional human nuclear family. Animal studies strives to reexamine traditional ethical political and epistemological categories in the context of a renewed attention to and respect for animal life. The assumption that focusing on animals might clarify human knowledge is neatly expressed in Claude LÃ©viStrausss famous dictum that animals are good to think.
