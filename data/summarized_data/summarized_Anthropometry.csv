Anthropometry,"Anthropometry involves the systematic measurement of the physical properties of the human body. An early tool of physical anthropology it has been used for identification for the purposes of understanding human physical variation in paleoanthropology and in various attempts to correlate physical with racial and psychological traits.  anthropometry plays an important role in industrial design clothing design ergonomics and architecture where statistical data about the distribution of body dimensions in the population are used to optimize products. Anthropometric history became very useful for historians in answering questions that interested them. The history of anthropometry includes and spans various concepts both scientific and pseudoscientific such as craniometry. lead to changes in the distribution of body dimensions eg the rise in obesity and require regular updating of anthropometric data collections. It also includes correlations between various anthropometrics and personal identity mental typology. Auxologic is a broad term covering the study of all aspects of human physical growth. At various times in history applications of anthropometry have ranged from accurate scientific description and epidemiological analysis to rationales for eugenics and overtly racist social movements One of its misuses was the discredited pseudoscience phrenology. The average height in genetically and environmentally homogeneous populations is often proportional across a large number of individuals. Exceptional height variation around 20 deviation from a populations average within such a population is sometimes due to gigantism or dwarfism. populations for a variety of complex biological genetic and environmental factors among others. The average female height in Bolivia is 1422 cm 4 ft 80 in. The average male height in the Dinaric Alps is 1856 cm 6 ft 11 in. A great degree of variation occurs between even the most common bodies 66 of the population. Human weight varies extensively both individually and across populations. The age range where most females stop growing is 1518 years and the age range when most males stopgrowing is 1821 years. The most extreme documented examples of adults being Lucia Zarate who weighed 21 kg 47 lb and Jon Brower Minnoch who weighed 640 kg 1400 lb. Adult brain size varies from 9749 cm3 5949 cu in to 14981 cm3 9142 cu in in females. Right cerebral hemisphere is typically larger than the left whereas the cerebellar hemispheres are typically of more similar size. Size of the human stomach varies significantly in adults with one study showing volumes ranging from 520 cm3 32cu in to 874 kg 1927 lb. Human genitalia exhibit considerable individual variation with penis size differing substantially and vaginal size differing significantly in healthy adults. Human beauty and physical attractiveness have been preoccupations throughout history which often intersect with anthropometric standards. Cosmetology facial symmetry and waisthip ratio are three such examples where measurements are commonly thought to be higher. Anthropometric studies today are conducted to investigate the evolutionary significance of differences in body proportion between populations whose ancestors lived in different environments. Human populations exhibit climatic variation patterns similar to those of other largebodied mammals following Bergmanns rule which states that individuals in cold climates will tend to be larger than ones in warm climates.  anthropologists use anthropometric variation to reconstruct smallscale population history. For instance John Relethfords studies of early 20thcentury anthropometric data from Ireland show that the geographical patterning of body proportions still exhibits traces of the invasions by the English and Norse centuries ago. Human height is predetermined by the quality of the nutrition which used to be higher in the more developed countries. The research was based on the datasets for Southern Chinese contract migrants who were sent to Suriname and Indonesia and included 13000 individuals. Today anthropometry can be performed with threedimensional scanners.  collaborative study to examine the uses of threedimensional scanners for health care was launched in March 2007. The aim is to establish whether the Body Volume Index has the potential to be used as a longterm computerbased anthropometric measurement. In 2001 UK conducted the largest sizing survey to date using scanners. SizeUK showed that the nation had become taller and heavier but not as much as expected. Since 1951 when the last womens survey had taken place the average weight for women had gone up from 62 to 65 kg. However recent research has shown that posture of the participant significantly influences the measurements taken the precision of 3D body scanner may or may not be high enough for. 3D Body Scanning has been suggested as a replacement for body measurement prediction technologies. Despite the great appeal have yet to be as reliable as real human data Baropodographic devices fall into two main categories i floorbased and ii inshoe. The ultimate form of the data generated by all modern technologies is either a 2D image or a time series of the pressures acting under the plantar surface of the foot. The spatial and temporal resolutions of the images generated by commercial pedobarographic systems range from approximately 3 to 10 mm and 25 to 500 Hz respectively. Neuroimaging Direct measurements involve examinations of brains from corpses or more recently imaging techniques such as MRI which can be used on living persons. Such measurements are used in research on neuroscience and neuroscience and are often used in the field of neuroscience. Brain volume data and other craniometric data are used in mainstream science to compare modernday animal species and to analyze the evolution of the human species. Anthropometric measurements also have uses in epidemiology and medical anthropology for example in helping to determine the relationship between various body measurements height weight percentage body fat etc and medical outcomes. Forensics and criminology Forensic anthropologists study the human skeleton in a legal setting. diagnose malnutrition in resourcepoor clinical settings. Forensic anthropologist can assist in the identification of a decedent through various skeletal analyses that produce a biological profile. People with significant European or Middle Eastern ancestry generally have little to no prognathism. People with considerable African ancestry typically have a broad and round nasal cavity no dam or nasal sill. Quonset hutshaped nasal bones notable facial projection in the face. A relatively small prognathism often characterizes people with considerable East Asian ancestry. A horseshoeshaped palate and a rounded and nonsloping eye orbit shape. No nasal sill or dam. tentshaped nasal bones. jaw and mouth area. Ergonomics is an understanding of human factors to the design of equipment systems and working methods. This includes physical ergonomics in relation to human anatomy, physiological and bio mechanical characteristics and cognitive ergonomics in relation to perception, memory and motor response. Biometrics refers to the identification of humans by their characteristics or traits. ergonomics in relation to metrics of communication crew resource management work design schedules teamwork participation community cooperative work new work programs virtual organizations and telework environmental ergonomicics. Biometrics is used in computer science as a form of identification and access control. It is also used to identify individuals in groups that are under surveillance. Biometric identifiers are often categorized as physiological versus behavioral characteristics. Subclasses include dermatoglyphics and soft biometrics. CAESAR began in 1997 as a partnership between government represented by the US Air Force and NATO and industry represented by SAE International. Survey of US Military personnel between 1945 and 1988 including the 1988 Army Anthropometric Survey ANSUR of men and women with its 240 measures. The study was conducted from April 1998 to early 2000 and included three scans per person in a standing pose fullcoverage pose and relaxed seating pose. The project collected and organized data on 2400 US Canadian and 2000 European civilians. This database records the anthropometric variability of men and women aged 1865 of various weights ethnic groups gender geographic regions and socioeconomic status. Highresolution measurements of body surfaces were made using 3D Surface Anthropometry. This technology can capture hundreds of thousands of points in three dimensions on the human body surface in a few seconds. It has many advantages over the old measurement system using tape measures anthropometers and other similar instruments. ALR technology was used to extract anatomical landmarks from the 3D body scans automatically. transfer to ComputerAided Design CAD or Manufacturing CAM tools. The resulting scan is independent of the measurer making it easier to standardize Automatic landmark recognition. Scientists working for private companies and government agencies conduct anthropometric studies to determine a range of sizes for clothing and other items. For just one instance measurements of the foot are used in the manufacture and sale of footwear measurement devices. education level and present occupation family income and more were also captured. Manufacturer ALINEr. manufacture eg ALINER. manufacture ALiner is based in the U.S. and is a major supplier of clothing and accessories to the fashion industry. The company has a range of products, including clothing, accessories and home decor."
