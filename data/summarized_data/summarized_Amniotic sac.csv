Amniotic sac,"The amniotic sac is the sac in which the embryo and later fetus develops in amniotes. It is a thin but tough transparent pair of membranes that hold a developing embryo until shortly before birth. The outer membrane the chorion contains the amnion and is part of the placenta. The yolk sac, amnion chorion and allantois are the four extraembryonic membranes that lie outside of the embryo. They are involved in providing nutrients and protection to the developing embryo. The membranes form from the inner cell mass the first to form is the yolks sac. Amniocentesis is a medical procedure where fluid from the sac is sampled during fetal development between 15 and 20 weeks of pregnancy to be used in prenatal diagnosis of chromosomal abnormalities and fetal infections. The amniotic cavity is the closed sac between the embryo and the amnion containing theAmniotic fluid. The chorion surrounds the embryo for about a month and eventually fuses with the Amnion. The amniotic cavity is formed when a cavity appears within the inner cell mass of the embryo. The floor of the cavity is created by the epiblast which migrates between epiblastic disc and trophoblast. In this way the amniotics cavity is also known as the 'epiblast'  epiblastic cells migrate between the embryoblast and trophoblast. The floor is formed by the epiblast which later on transforms to ectoderm. The amniotic cavity is surrounded by an extraembryonic membrane called the amnion. Amniogenic amnionforming cells called amnioblasts separate from the epiblast. The embryonic disc now lies between the amniotic cavity and the exocoelomic cavity. This membrane along with hypoblast forms the primary yolk sac. The amniotic sac is the membrane surrounding the primary yolk sac. It is shiny and very smooth but tough when seen in the light. If big parts of the membrane remain coating the newborn this is called a caul. When the baby is pushed out of the mothers uterus the umbilical cord placenta and amniotics are pushed out in the afterbirth. Chorioamnionitis is inflammation of the amniotic sac chorio amnion itis usually because of infection. It is a risk factor for neonatal sepsis. During labor the sac must break so that the child can be born. This is a site of exchange of essential substances between the umbilical cord and the fetus. PROM is a rupture of the amnion that occurs prior to the onset of labor. known as rupture of membranes ROM Normally it occurs spontaneously at full term either during or at the beginning of labor A premature rupture of membrane also known as an amniotomy may be clinically performed using an amnihook.  infection of the amniotic sac in a very small number of cases. Infection more commonly arises vaginally and is often referred to as a ""meningitis of the sac"" or ""amniotic meningitis"" It can also be called a ""fungal infection"""
