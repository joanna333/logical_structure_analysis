Diabetes self-management,Diabetes selfmanagement refers to the ongoing process in which individuals with diabetes actively participate in managing their condition. Diabetes is a chronic disease affecting over 537 million adults worldwide in 2021 and predicted to reach 643 million people by 2030. It is a global health burden and improving the health outcomes for people with diabetes. Selfmanagement is the cornerstone for successful health outcomes in diabetes patients. There is a positive association between selfmanagement behaviour and care outcomes. Healthcare organisations are increasingly focusing on providing diabetes. diabetes is critical to reducing the economic and human burden of diabetes. Diabetes patients face daily challenges due to the impact of their decisions on their health outcomes. Diabetes selfmanagement helps diabetes patients to make better decisions and change their behaviour to achieve better outcomes. The seven selfcare behaviours are healthy eating monitoring indicators of diabetes physical activity taking medication healthy. Foot care for diabetes patients is important. Poor knowledge about selfcare increases the risk of amputation. Good knowledge and practice regarding diabetes foot care can reduce the risk. Regular examination of the foot is key to good foot care for diabetic patients. Footwear tailored to the specific pathology of the patient can enable conservative management of the foot including debridement of the callus. Footwear can reduce abnormal pressure reduce the rate of formation callus and ulcers and protect the foot from external trauma. Regular monitoring of blood glucose and optimal glucose control is a major part of monitoring the foot risk factors.  diabetes selfmanagement Diabetes patients need to be capable of testing blood sugar at home at the recommended frequency. Frequent self monitoring of blood glucose and record keeping is key to identifying the possibility of hypoglycemia. Diabetes patients should be able to know how to respond when blood sugar levels are too high or too low. Nonadherence to medication leads to poor treatment outcomes and the progression of diseases and complications. The medication adherence of type 1 and type 2 diabetes patients assessed using selfreport pill counts electronic monitoring devices and medication possession ratio found that the medication adherence rates ranged from 31 to 87.  persistence is defined by the proportion of patients who remained in treatment for a predetermined period. The persistence rates ranged from 16 to 63 at 12 months and ranged from 29 to 70. Physical activity has a favourable influence on the health and wellbeing of diabetes patients. Diabetes patients can undertake light to moderate physical activity. The type of physical activity that can be performed by diabetes patients needs to be determined after consultations with health care providers. The physical activities recommended for diabetes patients include brisk walking recreational games and leisure time activities. A healthy diet is one component of the management of diabetes. Dietary selfcare behaviours include eating a lowsaturatedfat diet and controlling the amount of carbohydrates in food. Sticking to the eating plan and following the diet plan when eating from a restaurant or when feeling stressed is a major challenge. Selfmanagement data involve only a small and highly selected sample which does not represent the minorities and disadvantaged communities. Study conducted on a heterogeneous sample of population including minorities found that selfmanagement is essential to enhance the daily diabetes management of diabetes patients. recommended practices and patterns specific behaviors of primary daily diabetes selfmanagement. Retired individuals and homemakers have better selfmanagement than employed individuals. Diabetes patients need to actively selfmanage their diseases in everyday life for good diabetes outcomes. However there are certain barriers to the effective daytoday management of the disease. Financial difficulties cause diabetes care to be a barrier to effective selfmanagement as it prevents access to food healthcare medication and information. Lack of financial resources is on the food consumption pattern resulting in a vicious cycle of high carbohydrate consumption and hyperglycaemia. Diabetes patients with limited financial resources often report that they find it difficult to purchase adequate food. People from poor financial backgrounds choose food over medicine to save costs. Diabetes management is a problem of least importance as they have more pressing needs such as feeding the family and repaying loans. Medications are often taken with diabetes complications or the development of comorbid illness. Patients who attribute diabetes control to god are less likely to selfmanage and control their sugar intake. Study found that subjective norms attributed to 49 of the variance in the intent to perform diabetesrelated selfmanagement. Individuals and their familys beliefs about diabetes influence how they make sense of their disease and make efforts to manage their illness. In Subsaharan Africa diabetes patients face social stigma from family and community members. Decision to not follow the required dietary pattern is because they believe that their family friends and peers would not approve of their diet. Inadequate family support and cultural beliefs prevent diabetes patients from adhering to a diet with lowsaturated fatty acids. When diabetes. runs in the family it becomes a family affair and participants normalise and downplay the seriousness of the disease. Women responsible for house duties were found to have inadequate time to visit health facilities resulting in their ignoring their health care needs such as diabetes management. Lack of knowledge and poor selfcare practice is increasing the severity of diabetes every year. The level of education is a factor that has a positive correlation with selfcare knowledge. Family support is highly beneficial for effective selfcare. Diabetesrelated stigma leads to a lack of family support and poor diabetesrelated selfmanagement behaviours. Inadequate coordination between the health care providers and diabetes patients is a major barrier to properly implementing the care guidelines. Lack of collaboration and coordination leads to information conflict affecting the quality of selfmanagement. attitude of healthcare professionals as they wrote prescription and directions without a proper conversation with the patients. People from economically disadvantaged backgrounds can have limited access to care which is one reason for inadequate coordination between healthcare providers and patients. Healthcare professionals play a crucial role in diabetes selfmanagement. Diabetes patients rely on health care professionals to obtain information and support in developing an individualised treatment plan. Lack of proper emphasis on selfmanagement may suggest to diabetes patients that selfmanagement is either less important or even unimportant for diabetes management. Selfmanagement goals and recommendations given by health care professionals were identified to have a significant positive impact on the eating habits and physical activity of diabetes patients.
