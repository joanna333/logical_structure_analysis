Breastmilk medicine,Breastmilk medicine refers to the nonnutritional usage of human breast milk. Breastmilk is perceived as an important food that provides essential nutrition. It also provides protection in terms of immunity by direct transfer of antibodies from mothers to infants. The effectiveness of HBM and fresh colostrum as a treatment for inflammatory disorders such as rhinitis skin infection soring nipples and conjunctivitis has been reported. Currently many breastmilk components have shown therapeutic effects on a number of chronic diseases. HBM can be used to treat inflammations. Breastfeeding has an antiinflammatory effect that is conveyed by its chemical components interaction with body cells. The major chemical component that produces the anti inflammatory effect in both colostrum and transitional milk are glycoprotein and lactoferrin. Lactoferrin protects infants against bacterial and fungal infections in combination with other peptides present in HBM Respiratory viral infection in infants. Antiinflammatory effects attributed to its ironbinding properties inhibition of inflammationcausing molecules including interleukin1β IL1β and tumor necrosis factoralpha TNFα preservation of an antioxidant environment. Lactoferrin can interact directly with the F glycoprotein which is a protein on the surface of the virus that is responsible for presenting the virus to body cells and causing infections. HBM can also inhibit the invasion and proliferation of respiratory syncytial virus RSV. Lactoferrin can prevent infection of adenovirus since it can interfere with the primary receptors of the virus. HBM regurgitation into the nose after breastfeeding is a way to eliminate these mucosal bacteria and protect infants against recurring nose infections in breastfed infants. Atopic eczema affects 50 of infants in the first year after birth. Skin thickening may result in chronic or subacute patients due to scratching and fissuring over time. Nonprescription cream containing an antiinflammatory agent 1 hydrocortisone is commonly used. Diaper dermatitis is another prevalent infant dermatological disorder. Common clinical features of diaper dermatitis include inflamed itchy tender skin and soreness in the diaper area. Study results have shown that human breastmilk is highly effective in healing diaper rash. The immunological components in HBM help strengthen the babys immune system. These include antimicrobial proteins that can inhibit or kill a wide range of pathogens. This antimicrobial effect could be achieved by indirectly creating an unfavorable environment for the growth of pathogens by modifying commensal flora pH or level of bacterial substrates. Topical application of expressed breastmilk has long been a nonpharmacological intervention to reduce nipple pain. According to the research outcome of many studies topical application of HBM can help reduce the perception of nipple pain in a treatment course of 4 to 4 weeks. HBM is more effective in lowering pain perception than Lanolin. Lanolin produces lower pain levels in mothers with nipple pain than HBM. Lanolin shows a better therapeutic effect for healing rates nipple trauma and nipple pain. Although lanolin may be more efficacious than H BM to cure nipple problems HBM is not proven to be ineffective. The topical application of breastmilk as a treatment for an infectious disease called conjunctivitis has been present since ancient times in different nations such as ancient Egypt Rome Greece etc. HBM was also recommended by the Greek physician Galen as a remedy for conjunctvitis. Gonorrhea is a sexually transmitted infection. It can also be transmitted to babies during childbirth. This infectious disease can cause neonatal conjunctivitis which could lead to blindness if untreated Hospitals in the United States are required to apply HBM.  apply antibiotics to the eyes of newborn within one hour of childbirth to prevent the development of conjunctivitis. Certain bacteria in HBM are found to be effective against gonorrhea bacteria and may serve as a convenient and readily available substitute for antibiotics. Dry care method involving soap and water is recommended by the WHO and many national health organizations. umbilical cord dries out and eventually separates after 515 days. topical application of breast milk will lead to a shorter time of cord separation than other methods. HBM component of HBM can be extracted by chromatography from breast milk. complexes with oleic acid to form a protein called the human alphalactalbumin made lethal to tumor cells. The HAMLET complex induces apoptosis in lung carcinoma cells. HAMLET has shown preventative and therapeutic effects in reducing and controlling tumor growth. Researchers interest in HBM is led by the discovery of a number of chemical components. These components include growth factors cytokines and a heterogeneous population of cells which are stem cells probiotic bacteria and the HAMLET complex. The HAMLET has also been found to have antibacterial effects through the inhibition of enzymes in glycolysis HBM and high prevalence of infant inflammation disorders breastmilk may be a cheap and convenient ways to relieve inflammatory symptoms. Prophylactic antibiotic use of human milk may be important in areas where mothers and infants do not have easy access to medicine such as people living in developing countries. Some mothers may not be able to breastfeed due to psychological or physiological reasons. For instance breastfeeding selfefficacy the mothers confidence in her breastfeeding abilities is positively associated with exclusive breastfeeding. Mothers who have undergone breast surgeries such as mastectomy may have reduced capabilities of HBM production. HIV and bacterial infections from the mother may be transmitted through HBM causing complications for infants. There is difficulty in the generalization of study results in evidencebased practice due to inconsistencies in the clinical study findings. HBM compositions are diverse among different individuals or the same individual at various times. Protein composition in HBM is higher in the earlier stages of lactation. factors such as maternal diet and changes at various times after pregnancy. These changes may affect the effectiveness of HBM in medical use. The mother produces more mature milk which is whiter in color compared to the yellowish colostrum.
