Anthropocene Working Group,The Anthropocene Working Group AWG is an interdisciplinary research group dedicated to the study of the Anthropocene as a geological time unit. It was established in 2009 as part of the Subcommission on Quaternary Stratigraphy SQS. As of 2021 the research group features 37 members. The Anthropocene Working Group was established in 2009. The AWG's goal is to formalize the Anthropocene as an epoch within the Geologic time scale. The main goal of the AWG is to provide scientific evidence robust enough to be formally ratified by the IUGS. Paul Crutzen and Eugene Stoermer published in May 2000 an article on the IGBP Global Change Newsletter called The Anthropocene. Later in 2002 Crutszen published a commentary on Nature titled Geology of Mankind where he further stressed the idea to assign the term Anthropocene to the present in many ways. Supporters of the Early Anthropocene Hypothesis date the beginning of the Anthropocene as far back as the Neolithic Revolution. Supporters of more recent starting dates from European Colonization of the Americas to the late 18th century to the Industrial Revolution. Jan Zalasiewicz and other members of the Stratigraphy Commission of the Geological Society of London published a paper that considered the possibility to amplify and extend the discussion of the effects referred to by Crutzen. They then applied the same criteria used to set up new epochs to ask whether there really is a new epoch. In 2009 the Subcommission on Quaternary Stratigraphy established an Anthropocene Working Group to examine the status of the Anthropocene as a potential new formal division of the Geological Time Scale. Some authors have labelled this justification or need for a new term and if so where and how its boundary might be placed. The AWG acknowledges the Anthropocene as an object of geological interest in the scientific community. First inperson meeting of the AWG took place in October 2014 at Haus der Kulturen der Welt Berlin HKW. AWG has been actively publishing ever since then. HKW acquired in 2018 financial support for a systematic assessment of potential candidates for the Anthropocenes Global boundary Stratotype Section and Point GSSP. In 2020 Colin Waters previously secretary of the AWG became the new chair replacing the paleobiologist Jan Zalasiewicz. The Anthropocene Working Group is one of four workings groups part of the Subcommission on Quaternary Stratigraphy. The AWG members include Paul Crutzen who was awarded the Nobel prize for chemistry in 1995 for his researcher on ozone depletion. The Phanerozoic Eon started 539 million years ago determining the current Eon. Since no direct funding supports the research program communication among members happens mostly through email whereas meetings are usually founded by hosting institutions. As for most of the epochs in the Phanrozoic the currentEon starting 539m years ago. The Anthropocene is a geochronological chronostratigraphic taxonomic equivalent of an epoch. A lower boundary is defined by locating a GSSP informally known as golden spike in the stratigraphic section of a stage. It is usually implemented for Precambrian boundaries. There is a specific set of rules that a GSSP must fulfill in order to be recognized as a valid primary geologic marker. A central object of research for the AWG is establishing when where and how to locate the lower boundary of the Anthropocene. The AWG has been considering the Anthropocene to best fit the requirements to be taxonomically recognized as an epoch. In January 2014 the Geological Society of London published a collection of scientific essays dedicated to assessing and analyzing theÂ Anthropocene. The AWG published The Anthropocene as a Geological Time Unit A Guide to the Scientific Evidence and Current Debate in February 2019. The volume constitutes a landmark publication for the AWG collecting a preliminary body of scientific evidence for the Anthropocene and establishing research areas and trajectories retraced. Anthropocene is a geological time unit. The monograph also links the Anthropocene to the question concerning anthropogenic climate change. The role of human technology and the technosphere in impacting the functioning of the Earth system is also discussed. In the first. extensive summary of evidence collected supporting the case of formalization of the. In May 2019 the AWG completed a binding vote determining two major research questions Should the Anthropocene be treated as a formal chronostratigraphic unit defined by a GSSP? Should the primary guide for the base of the anthropocene be one of the stratigraphic signals around the midtwentieth century of the Common Era?  AWG proposed Crawford Lake Canada as GSSP candidate site of the Anthropocene series. 29 votes in favor 4 votes against and no abstention 33 votes received out of 34 potential voting members. In 2016 seven prominent members of the AWG were interviewed in the feature documentary Anthropocene. The Anthropocene was the first featurelength film about the new epoch and was described by Earthcom as one of the top ten documentaries to help raise environmental awareness. The seven AWG members formed a broad consensus about the Anthropocenes history and the terms significance they took contrasting views when invited by director Steve Bradshaw to consider the Anthropocene either as a tragedy with extinctions and upheavals or as a dark comedy.
