Ascribed characteristics,Ascribed characteristics refers to properties of an individual attained at birth by inheritance or through the aging process. The individual has very little if any control over these characteristics. Typical examples include race ethnicity gender caste height and appearance. The term is apt for describing characteristics chiefly caused by nature eg genetics and for those chiefly causedby nurture eg parenting during early childhood. Demography being the statistical study of populations requires the ability to differentiate between populations. Most populations selfascribe themselves as being different from others by the creation of a country. However useful countries have significant complex populations that require more exacting definitions. Commonly seen are uses of race gender and ethnicity. Ascribed characteristics can have large byproducts whether perceived or not. Ascribed characteristics are not always used for academic purposes. People with certain ascribed. characteristics can be systematically treated with prejudice. Thus the study of racism can be used to form new theories. Frank van Tubergen studied the how ascribed characteristics and achieved characteristics affect their social capital. The article highlighted that women have less social capital than men in Saudi Arabia citing specifically that it is because of their skin color and cultural background. seen at least superficially as the study of how people with a certain skin color are systematically treated differently by society at large. There are many arguments that stem from disagreements over the definition of what is a fact when it comes to gender. For example people who find homosexuality morally objectionable may attempt to justify this by insisting that homosexuals make a conscious decision about the nature of the sexual desire they experience. It would difficult to condemn homosexuality if homosexuality was predetermined either genetically or due to fewer nonfamily connections. Both groups do however use the term all the same simply ascribing different definitions to those individuals. Social status caste Many different societies have had varying types of social stratification both historically and in the modern era. or from early childhood See Sexual orientation Ronald P Dore was a British sociologist that was a specialist in the Japanese economy. In his largest work British Factory Japanese Factory Dore investigates whether decisions on hiring and promotion in Hitachi over a particular time were based chiefly on achievement or chiefly on ascribed characteristics. Some achievement characteristics are positively correlated with some ascribed characteristics such as intelligence and socioeconomic success. Power to commandmay be much more likely to be bred in upper class families to the extent that the power to command is viewed as a measure of merit. It can be difficult to tell whether a particular promotion decision has been made for just or unjust reasons. It is possible to irrelevantly acquire discriminatory characteristics or even do so intentionally. For example by converting to a new religion or getting married. Even some ascribed characteristics should affect employee compensation. Dore points out that what counts as an ascribed characteristic can vary depending on context. In evaluating the fairness of hiring standards he viewed an applicants success in the educational system as a good approximation of achievement. correlated both with performance and with age. Hiring decisions at Hitachi during the time of his study were regulated by very strict qualification standards. Dore noted that educational qualificationslimit the range of posts which one can achieve. Even if ones level of achievement increases one may still be kept down by a relative lack of achievement in the educational system. These additional forms of ascribed characteristics expand on the definition of an ascribed characteristic allowing for it to have more applications. investigating opportunities for promotions educational achievement the two become another form of ascribing characteristic. investigating opportunity for promotions and educational achievement.
