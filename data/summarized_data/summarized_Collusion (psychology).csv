Collusion (psychology),Collusion is a psychological term for behavioral patterns in relationships for couples therapy. In contemporary psychotherapeutical practice collusion often refers to a failure of the therapist to maintain neutrality or objectivity. It highlights the importance of selfawareness and reflective practice for the therapist. The term collusion in psychotherapy was first introduced by Sándor Ferenczi in 1933. He described collusion as an unconscious process linking the therapist and the patient. Jaspers did not use the term collusion explicitly in the way it is commonly understood today. Instead his work laid the groundwork for understanding interpersonal dynamics. Henry V Dicks defined collusion as an unconscious unresolved issue shared by two or more participants who become interlocked in a defensive maneuver. Jürg Willi further explored the concept in his book Marital Tensions. transference reactions of the patient with the countertransference reaction of clinicians leading to specific and often complex dynamics. The Dyadic Relationship Die Zweierbeziehung is a book about the concept of collusion. The author interprets collusion to be the unconscious interaction between partners. He delivers an overview of classical phases of two partner couples relationships. The avoidance of conflicts in these phases is triggering the emergence of collusions. The suggested collusion concept tries to unite different therapy schools in a single theory. He combines different aspects of psychoanalytical Psychoanalysis family therapeutic Family therapy and communication therapeutic methods. He derives four collusion patterns Love as to be one in the narcissistic collusion Love as caring for each other in the oral collusion. The author understands the dyad as a halfopen system and describes the function of third persons in the collusion conflict. For the advancement of a couple relationships with third persons are necessary. The author restricts himself to considering only those forms that contribute to not carry out a conflict. Narcissistic collusion presents as follows Partner A mostly the male shows himself grandiose his partner complementary narcissistic. couple illness and their consequences for the collusion A psychosomatic illness has a similar meaning as a third person Finally the author describes therapeutic aspects of couples therapy and their effect and application of the collusion concept. She herself feels small and not worthy of love she is fixated on him or a third person. She presents herself unobtrusive with a tendency to selfdestructive behavior for example overloading or drug use. He sees her as a decorative part of himself she seeks a substitute self in him.

The fosterling often reacts depressive to the caretaker's treatment of her.  Counseling can help the couple to practice their roles and to reflect experiences and resistances Analsadistic collusion Both partners have the common resistance against the idea that the relationship would break if both partners behaved freely and autonomously. This leads to power struggles sadomasochism and jealousyinfidelity patterns. Most likely both partners have an unresolved relationship to their opposite sex parent. In the phallic collusion the male partner follows inflated male claims while he stays. Human goes through a complex developing process as a small child that leads to a sexual identity as boy or girl. The frequency and the shaping of sexual encounters are entrusted with the female partner. Not uncommonly there is no sex at all. The mating choice in the oedipal collusion is more directly tied to the opposite sex parent Often a much older partner is chosen and passivereserved.  humans in deep oedipal entanglement tend to invade the marriages of other humans. Sometimes a partner is chosen who is completely unlike the opposite sex parent to avoid the tight connectedness from childhood. sometimes the son stays with the mother or the daughter stays withthe father.
