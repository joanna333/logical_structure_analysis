Anatomical terms of muscle,Anatomical terminology is used to uniquely describe aspects of skeletal muscle cardiac muscle and smooth muscle. There are three types of muscle tissue in the body skeletal smooth and cardiac Skeletal muscle enables movement of bones and maintains posture. The widest part of a muscle that pulls on the tendons is known as the belly.  smooth muscle is involuntary and found in parts of the body where it conveys action without conscious intent. The majority of this type of muscle tissue is found in the digestive and urinary systems where it acts by propelling forward food chyme and feces in the former and urine in the latter.  unique terminology is used to describe the action of a set of muscles. found are within the uterus where it helps facilitate birth and the eye where the pupillary sphincter controls pupil size Cardiac muscle is specific to the heart It is also involuntary in its movement and is additionally selfexcitatory contracting. Agonist muscles are also called prime movers since they produce most of the force and control of an action. Agonists cause a movement to occur through their own activation. For example the triceps brachii contracts producing a shortening concentric contraction during the up phase of a pushup elbow extension. The triceps brachii continues to be the prime mover or controller of the joint action. The elbow flexor group is the agonist shortening during the lifting phase elbow flexion During the lowering phase the elbowflexor muscles lengthen remaining the agonists because they are controlling the load. Extensor muscles are the antagonists see below. They lengthen during the dumbbell lifting phase and shorten during the Dumbbell lowering phase. Antagonist muscles are simply the extensor muscles. See below for more information on the different types of extensor muscle. The opposing joint torque to the agonist muscles can aid in controlling a motion. For example during a very rapid ballistic discrete movement of the elbow such as throwing a dart the triceps muscles will be activated very briefly and strongly in a burst to rapidly accelerate the extension movement. Antagonism is not an intrinsic property of a particular muscle or muscle group. It is a role that a muscle plays depending on which muscle is currently the agonist. During slower joint actions that involve gravity the antagonist muscle can shorten and lengthen. To use an automotive analogy this would be like pressing the accelerator pedal rapidly and then immediately pressing the brake. E elbow flexor muscles are antagonists at the elbow during both the up phase and down phase of the movement. During the dumbbell curl the elbow extensors are the antagonists for both the lifting and lowering phases Antagonistic pairs Antagonist and agonist muscles often occur in pairs called antagonistic pairs As one muscle contracts the other relaxes. Reverse motions need antagonistic pairs located in opposite sides of a joint or bone. These consist of an extensor muscle which opens the joint and a flexor muscle which does the opposite by decreasing the angle between two bones. However muscles do not always work this way sometimes agonists and antagonists contract at the same time to produce force as per Lombards paradox.  sometimes during a joint action controlled by an agonist muscle the antagonist will be slightly activated naturally. This occurs normally and is not considered to be a problem unless it is excessive or uncontrolled and disturbs the control of the joint action. This is called agonistantagonist coactivation and serves to mechanically stiffen the joint. Synergist muscles can also act to counter or neutralize the force of an agonist. They are also known as neutralizers when they do this. As neutralizers they help to cancel out orneutralize extra motion produced from the agonists to ensure that the force generated works within the desired plane of motion.  limitation in the range of contraction affects all muscles. Those that act over several joints may be unable to shorten sufficiently to produce the full range of movement at all of them simultaneously active insufficiency eg the fingers cannot be fully flexed when the wrist is also flexed. Synergists are muscles that facilitate the fixation action. type of action to fix certain of the joints so that others can be moved effectively eg fixation of the wrist during full flexion of the fingers in clenching the fist. A true synergist muscle is one that only neutralizes an undesired joint action. A muscle that fixes or holds a bone so that the agonist can carry out the intended movement is said to have a neutralizing action. A good famous example of this are the hamstrings the semitendinosus and semimembranosus muscles perform knee flexion and knee internal rotation. For the knee to flex while not rotating in either direction all three muscles contract. Composite or hybrid muscles have more than one set of fibers that perform the same function and are usually supplied by different nerves. For example the tongue itself is a composite muscle made up of various components like longitudinal transverse horizontal muscles with different parts innervated from a different nerve supply. By shape deltoid means triangular quadratus means having four sides rhomboideus means having a rhomboid shape teres means round or cylindrical trapezius meanshaving a trapezoid shape rectus means straight. By size brevis means short longus means long major means large maximus means largest minor means small and minimus smallest. The rectus abdominis is a muscle in the back of the body. It is one of the most important muscles in the human body. The muscle is inserted into the body by the abductor and the depressor. The abductor moves away from the midline adductor and towards theÂ midline depressor by moving downwards and upwards. The origin of a muscle is the bone typically proximal which has greater mass and is more stable during a contraction than a muscles insertion. anchored one at each end The connective tissue of the attachment is called an enthesis Origin is the origin site of the muscle. The head of a muscle also called caput musculi is the part at the end of the muscle at its origin where it attaches to a fixed bone. Some muscles such as the biceps have more than one head. Insertion is the structure that the muscle attaches to and tends to be moved by contraction. This may be a bone a tendon or the subcutaneous dermal connective tissue.  insertion is a bone that tends to be distal have less mass and greater motion than the origin during a contraction. Insertions are usually connections of muscle via tendon to bone. Intrinsic and extrinsic muscles have their origin in the part of the body that they act on and are contained within that part. Muscles may also be described by the direction that the muscle fibers run in their muscle architecture. Fusiform muscles have fibers that run parallel to the length of the muscle and are spindleshaped. Unipennate muscles have fiber that run the entire length of only one side of a muscle like a quill pen. Bipennate muscle is stronger than both unipennated muscle and fusiform muscle due to a larger physiological crosssectional area. Pennate muscles generally also tire easily. Examples of bipennate muscles are the rectus femoris muscle of the thigh and the stapedius muscle of middle ear.  muscle size from an increase in size of individual muscle cells. This usually occurs as a result of exercise and is usually caused by exercise. Muscle size can also be increased by the growth of individual cells in the body as well as larger groups of cells.
