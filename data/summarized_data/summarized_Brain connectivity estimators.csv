Brain connectivity estimators,Connectivity can be considered at different levels of the brains organisation from neurons to neural assemblies and brain structures. Brain connectivity involves different concepts such as neuroanatomical or structural connectivity pattern of anatomical links. functional connectivity usually understood as statistical dependencies and effective connectivity referring to causal interactions. Diffusion Weighted Imaging DWI can be used to provide such information. The distinction between functional and effective connectivity is not always sharp sometimes causal or causal or effective. Diffusion weighted imaging DWI is a form of brain imaging. It can provide information on the function executed but may be considered as pathways over regions of the brain.  functional connectivity may be defined as the temporal correlation in terms of statistically significant dependence between distant brain regions. directed connectivity is called functional connectivity. Some brain connectivity estimators evaluate connectivity from brain activity time series such as Electroencephalography EEG Local field. Different methods of connectivity estimation vary in their effectiveness. These estimators can be applied to fMRI data if the required image sequences are available. Among estimators of connectivity there are linear and nonlinear bivariate and multivariate measures. Certain estimators also indicate directionality.  Classical methods Classical estimators of connectivity are correlation and coherence. Nonlinear methods The most frequently used nonlinear estimators are mutual information. The above measures provide information on the directionality of interactions in terms of delay correlation or coherence phase however the information does not imply causal interaction.  transfer entropy generalised synchronisation the continuity measure synchronization likelihood and phase synchronization Mutual information and transfer entropy rely on the construction of histograms for probability estimates. Among these measures only transfer entropy allows for the determination of directionality. Nonlinear measures require long stationary segments. Nonlinear methods are prone to systematic errors and above all are very sensitive to noise. The comparison of nonlinear methods with linear correlation in the presence of noise reveals the poorer performance of non linear estimators. In the authors conclude that there must be good reason to think that there is nonlinearity in the data to apply non linear methods.  linear methods perform quite well for nonlinear signals. Nonlinear methods are bivariate calculated pairwise which has serious implication on their performance. In case of interrelated system of channels greater than two bivariate methods supply misleading information even reversal of true propagation may be found.  propagation is always obtained when there is a delay between channels which results in a lot of spurious flows. When we have two or three sources acting simultaneously which is a common situation we shall get dense and disorganized structure of connections similar to random structure at best.  effective connectivity patterns yielded by EEG or LFP measurements are far from randomness when proper multivariate measures are applied. The testable definition of causality was introduced by Granger Granger causality principle states that if some series Yt contains information in past terms some small world structure may be identified.  Granger causality principle can be expressed in terms of twochannel multivariate autoregressive model MVAR. Granger Causality Index GCI Directed Transfer Function DTF and Partial Directed Coherence PDC are measures based on the principle. that helps in the prediction of series Xt is said to cause Xt. The AR model assumes that Xta sample of data at a time tcan be expressed as a sum of p previous values of the samples from the set of ksignals weighted by model coefficients A plus a random value Et. The p is called the model order for a kchannel process. Hf is a transfer matrix of the system it contains information about the relationships between signals and their spectral characteristics. Hf is nonsymmetric so it allows for finding causal dependencies. Model order may be found by means of criteria developed in the framework of information.  Granger Causality Index showing the driving of channel x by channel y is defined as the logarithm of the ratio of residual variance for one channel to the residual variance of the twochannel model GCIyx ln ee1. This definition can be extended to the multichannel system by considering how the inclusion of the given channel changes the residual volatility ratios. N and n1 dimensional MVAR models. Granger causality is defined as G C I j i t ln V i n t V i i n 1 t displaystyle mathrm GCI _jrightarrow itln leftfrac V_intV_in1tright GCI is smaller or equal 1 since the variance of ndimensional system is lower. DTF or PDC are the estimators defined in the frequency domain. For brain signals the spectral characteristics of the signals is of interest because for a given task the increase of propagation in certain frequency band may be accompanied by the decrease in another frequency band. DTF was introduced by Kaminski and Blinowska.  is an element of a transfer matrix of MVAR model DTF describes causal influence of channel j on channel i at frequency f. DTF shows not only direct but also cascade flows namely in case of propagation 123 it shows also propagation 13.  Directed Transfer Function dDTF was introduced. The modification of DTF concerned normalization of the function in such a way as to make the denominator independent of frequency. DDTFji showing direct propagation from channel j to i is defined as Where Cijf is partial coherence. Distinguishing direct from indirect transmission is essential in case of signals from implanted electrodes for EEG signals recorded by scalp electrodes it is not really important. DTF may be used for estimation of propagation in cases of point processes eg spike trains or for the estimation of causal relations between spike trains and Local Field Potentials. Aijf is an element of Afa Fourier transform of MVAR model coefficients. Ajf is jth column of Af and the asterisk denotes the transpose and complex conjugate operation. Although it is a function operating in the frequency domain the dependence of Af on the frequency has not a direct correspondence to the power spectrum. The normalization of PDC affects the detected intensities of flow as was pointed out in Namely adding further variables that are influenced by a source variable decreases PDC. In other words the flow emitted in one direction will be enhanced in comparison to that emitted in another direction.  adaptive filtering or the method based on the sliding window may be applied to estimators of connectivity. Both methods require multiple repetition of the experiment to obtain statistically satisfactory results and they produce similar results. The adaptive methods eg Kalman filtering are more computationally efficient. Number of data points kNT knumber of channels NTnumber of points in the data window has to be bigger preferably by order of magnitude than the number of parameters which in case of MVAR is equal to k2p pmodel order. demanding therefore methods based on sliding window may be recommended. Estimation of MVAR coefficients is based on calculation of the correlation matrix between channels Rij of k signals Xi from multivariate set separately for each trial. The resulting model coefficients are based on the correlation Matrix averaged over trials. The correlation matrix has the form The choice of window size is always a compromise between quality of the fit and time resolution. The errors of the SDTF may be evaluated by means of bootstrap method. This procedure corresponds to simulations of other realizations of the experiment. The variance of the function value is obtained by repeated calculation of the results for a randomly selected with repetitions pool of the original data trials.  estimation of brain connectivity has found numerous and notable applications. The methods applied benefit from a parcellation approach where regions of the brain are defined from atlases or DWI data with connectivity metrics then extracted. DTF found multiple applications namely when investigating brain changes associated with the treatment of psychopathology like schizophrenia. SDTF is a technique used to measure brain activity in animals. It can be used to determine the transmission between brain structures during a behavioral test. One may observe the shifting of sources toward the front in transition from wakefulness to the deeper sleep stages. In the deep sleep the source is over corpus callosum. The results corresponded very well with the known phenomena of event related synchronization and desynchronization such as decrease of the activity in alpha and beta band and brief increase of activity in the gamma band during movement. The areas corresponding to primary motor cortex beta rebound after movement and socalled surround effect. Short burst of gamma propagation was observed from the electrode positioned over finger primary motor cortex. Crosstalk between different sites overlying motor area and supplementary motor area SMA was found. The dynamics of propagation may be observed in animations. Another applications of SDTF concerned evaluation of transmission during cognitive experiments. Test CAT confirmed the engagement of prefrontal and frontal structures in the task and supported the hypothesis of an active inhibition by preSMA and right inferior frontal cortex. Results obtained by means of SDTF in experiments involving working memory were compatible with fMRI studies on the localization of the active sites. DTF results obtained for signals recorded from the scalp are in general affected by volume conduction. Care should be taken to avoid spurious connectivity estimates when using EEG channel data. Even though the effects of volume Conduction might be minimal in specific recording situations appropriate preprocessing on channel data such as source data is needed. The existence of well defined sources of brain activity. connected with particular experimental conditions are well established in fMRI experiments. identification should be performed before estimating DTF or PDC. This kind of deterministic structure of brain. activity should affect functional connectivity so reported in some works random. This kind of results may be explained by methodological errors. Unrobust methods of connectivity estimation and even more important 2 application of bivariate methods. When multivariate robust measures of connectivity are applied for EEG analysis a clear picture of functional connectivity emerges.
