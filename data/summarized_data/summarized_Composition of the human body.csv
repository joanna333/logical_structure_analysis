Composition of the human body,Body composition may be analyzed in various ways. This can be done in terms of the chemical elements present or by molecular structure eg water protein fats or lipids hydroxyapatite in bones carbohydrates such as glycogen and glucose and DNA. In terms of cell type the body contains hundreds of different types of cells. About 99 of the mass of the human body is made up of six elements. Only about 085 is composed of another five elements potassium sulfur sodium chlorine and magnesium. All 11 are necessary for life The remaining elements are trace elements of which more than a dozen are thought on the basis of good evidence to be necessary. Less than 10 grams for a human body do not add up to the body mass of magnesium the least common of the 11 nontrace elements. Not all elements which are found in the human body in trace quantities play a role in life. Some of these elements are thought to be simple common contaminants without function. Bromine is used by some though not all bacteria fungi diatoms and seaweeds and opportunistically in eosinophils in humans. Levels in foods and dietary supplements are closely monitored to reduce or eliminate its intake. Some elements silicon boron nickel vanadium are probably needed by mammals also but in far smaller doses. The average 70 kg 150 lb adult human body contains approximately 71027 atoms and contains at least detectable traces of 60 chemical elements. About 29 of these elements are thought to play an active positive role in life and health in humans. The relative amounts of each element vary by individual mainly due to differences in the proportion of fat muscle and bone in their body. The adult human body averages 53 water. This varies substantially by age sex and adiposity. In a large sample of adults of all ages and both sexes the figure for water fraction by weight was found to be 48 6 for females and 58 8 water for males. The elements listed below are those listed by the US Food and Drug Administration as essential nutrients as well as six additional elements oxygen carbon hydrogen and nitrogen. Because of water content the human body contains more oxygen by mass than any other element but more hydrogen by atomfraction than any element. Of the 94 naturally occurring chemical elements 61 are listed in the table above. Of the remaining 33 it is not known how many occur in the human body. Most of the elements needed for life are relatively common in the body. Elements listed as Possibly or Probably essential are those cited as beneficial to human health. Aluminium is the third most common element in the Earths crust after oxygen and silicon. It serves no function in living cells but is toxic in large amounts. The composition of the human body can be classified as follows. Water Proteins Fats or lipids Hydroxyapatite in bones Carbohydrates such as glycogen and The estimated contents of a typical 20micrometre human cell is as follows. Muscle Fat Bone and teeth Nervous tissue brain and nerves Hormones Connective tissue Blood lymph urine Contents of digestive tract including intestinal gas Air in lungs Epithelium There are roughly as many microbial as human cells in the human body by number much less by mass or volume. Some of these symbionts are necessary for our health. Those that neither help nor harm humans are called commensal organisms. There are many species of bacteria and other microorganisms that live on or inside the healthy human body.
