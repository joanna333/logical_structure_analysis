Body Worlds,"Body Worlds German title Körperwelten is a traveling exposition of dissected human bodies animals and other anatomical structures of the body that have been preserved through the process of plastination. Gunther von Hagens developed the preservation process which unites subtle anatomy and modern polymer chemistry in the late 1970s. Von Hagens maintains that all human specimens were obtained with full knowledge and consent of the donors before they died. In 2004 von Hagens returned seven corpses to China because they showed evidence of being executed prisoners. A competing exhibition Bodies The Exhibition openly sources its bodies from unclaimed bodies in China. Body Worlds exhibition contains approximately 25 fullbody plastinates with expanded or selective organs shown in positions that enhance the role of certain systems. To produce specimens for Body Worlds von Hagens employs around 100 people at his laboratory in Guben Germany. The specimen took three years to completeten times longer than it takes to prepare a human body. Ten people are required to move the giraffe because its final weight like all specimens after plastination is equal to the original animal. Many of the wholebody specimens are partially dissected in the Écorché style. More than 200 specimens of real human organs and organ systems are typically separately displayed in glass cases. Some specimens such as the Tai Chi Man demonstrate interventions and include prosthetics such as artificial hip joints or heart valves. Often featured is a liver with cirrhosis and the lungs of a smoker and nonsmoker are placed for side by side comparison. Body Worlds exhibitions have received more than 50 million visitors making them the worlds most popular touring attraction. Body Worlds 2 The Brain Our Three Pound Gem concerning the brain and nervous system opened in 2005 at the California Science Center in Los Angeles. As of September 2010 it was showing at the. Several Body Worlds exhibits as well as von Hagens himself were featured in the 2006 film Casino Royale. Among the plastinates seen were the Poker Playing Trio which plays a key role in one scene and Rearing Horse and Rider. Body Worlds 3 The Story of the Heart concerning the cardiovascular system opened on 25 February 2006 at the Houston Museum of Natural Science. Body Worlds 4 debuted 22 February 2008 at the Museum of Science and Industry in Manchester in England. Body Worlds The Mirror of Time featuring human development and aging debuted at The O2 in London in October 2008. Körperwelten Der Zyklus Des Lebens The cycle of life opened in Heidelberg in January 2009. In 2017 the Tech Museum of Innovation in San Jose California opened a semipermanent exhibition called Body Worlds Decoded. Sponsored by venture capitalist John Doerr and his wife Ann the exhibit features plastinated specimens supplemented by augmented reality and a digital anatomy table. The exhibit is intended to run for at least 10 years. In 2005 the New York University College of Dentistry experimented with replacing traditional laboratory dissection with the study of dissected and plastinated slices of specimens. In July 2008 the Czech Senate passed a law to address illegal trading in human tissue and ban advertising of donation of human cells and tissues for money. French judge ruled concerning the Paris exhibition of Our Body The Universe Within that exhibiting dead bodies for profit was a violation of the respect owed to them. Judge LouisMarie Raingeard ordered the exhibition to close within 24 hours or face a fine of 20000 euro over 26000 dollars for each day it stayed open. Gunther von Hagens issued a press statement denying any connection between the closed Chinese exhibition and his Body Worlds franchise. Similar exhibitions had already been successfully staged in Lyon and Marseille. UK Parliament created legislation for exhibits of human remains including plastinated bodies and body parts in England and Wales under the Human Tissue Act 2004. The Human Tissue Act superseded the Anatomy Act 1832 which had been found by an independent commission to be inadequate on contemporary collection and use of human tissues. There was initially controversy over whether the exhibition needed a licence. But after consideration by the Department of Health it was found the legislation had not been designed to relate to exhibitions like Body Worlds. The Human Tissue Scotland Act 2006 which amended the Anatomy Act 1984 covers Scotland. Under the terms of this Act licences for the handling of human remains including display must be granted directly by the Scottish Ministry. In March 2008 the Manchester Museum of Science and Industry was granted such a licence to hold Body Worlds 4. In the interests of education training or research they may grant a license to a person to publicly display the body or as the case may be the part. Various organizations gave evidence to the Scottish Executive during the consultation process including the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh the Wellcome Trust and the Museums Association United.  Various legislation has been proposed and enacted in different American states. Most proposals concentrate on issues regarding the sale of human remains and the consent of the donors. National legislation on consent and tissue donation issues is expressed in the Uniform Anatomical Gift Act 2006. In early 2008 former US Republican Representative W Todd Akin proposed an amendment to the SmootHawley Tariff Act of 1930 to make it unlawful for a person to import plastinated human remains into the United States. The President of the American Association of Anatomists has expressed concern that the scope of the act is too broad.  Assembly Bill 1519 would have made California the first state to require such proof. It was vetoed by Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger. The bill of amendment was not enacted during the 20072008 Congressional session California Californias proposed bill AB1519 Ma sponsored by Assemblywoman Fiona Ma tried to require exhibitors to get a county permit. The state of Florida prohibits the sale or purchase of human remains. Authorizes certain science centers located in this state to transport plastinated bodies into within or out of this state and exhibit such bodies for the purpose of public education without the consent of this states anatomical board. The Museum of Science and History in Jacksonville has hosted BODY WORLDS exhibitions. Hawaii introduced two bills prompted by presentation of the BODIES Exhibition in that state. HB28 Relating to Dead Human Bodies would add to the prohibition against buying dead human bodies. In June 2008 New York State Senate passed legislation regulating body exhibits. increase the fine for buying or selling a dead human body to up to 5000 HB29 Relating to Dead Human Bodies would prohibit the commercial display of dead human bodies without a permit from the Department of Health. Pennsylvania Representative Mike Flecks proposed bill would require evidence of informed consent from the decedent or relatives of all humans whose remains are put on display. Washington considered a bill that would require written authorization to display human remains for a commercial purpose. There have been several reports of corpses in the Body Worlds exhibit being prepared and shown without consent. In January 2004 the German news magazine Der Spiegel reported based on internal emails and records as well as statements from von Hagens that his company had acquired corpses from executed Chinese prisoners. In response to the article Von Hagens said that he has told his Chinese employees not to accept bodies that were executed. In 2004 von Hagens obtained an injunction against Der Spiegel for making the claims. North Carolinas State Board of Funeral Services has stated Somebody at some level of government ought to be able to look at a death certificate a statement from an embalmer donation documents. Two Russian doctors were charged with illegally supplying von Hagens with 56 bodies in 2002. Von Hagens said that none of the body parts were used in the Body Worlds exhibitions. Consent is not regulated worldwide according to the same ethical standards raising ethical concerns. Each plastinated corpse is made anonymous to protect its privacy. Paperwork is separated from the bodies which can be used for displays or sold in pieces to medical schools. No one will know for sure because each plastination corpse is anonymous. Body Worlds made its US debut in 2004. Plastinated human specimens are classified under Customs Classification Code 9705000048 items in anatomical collections. This customs code encompasses zoological botanical mineralogical items. on display. International trade experts have objected to the way in which bodies for commercial display are imported.  Ethical concerns about cadaver displays. or anatomical collections or items in such collections. Ethicists have compared such displays to pornography in that they reduce the subject to the manipulation of body parts stripped of any larger human significance. In a 2006 lecture entitled PlastiNation How America was Won Lucia Tanassi professor of medical ethics and anthropology at Vanderbilt. University Medical Center explored questions for ethicists regarding this new scientific frontier Tanassi called it provocative that ethics committees have contributed to the popularization of the exhibits without setting forth any process of a line of inquiry. Concerns have been expressed about the educational aspects of the exhibit. St Louis Archbishop Raymond Burke strongly suggested that Catholic schools avoid scheduling field trips. Concerned with how some kids process these graphic images Des McKay school superintendent in Abbotsford British Columbia near Greater Vancouver barred field trips to exhibits of plasticized human beings. Some religious groups including some rabbis have objected to the display. The Catholic Schools Office of Phoenixacknowledge the educational content of Body Worlds. The Times stated Body Worlds should be compulsory viewing for every child of 10 or over. The Abbotsford News questions what effect the exhibits will have on the values of children attending for school field trips. Archdiocese of Milwaukee wrote a reflection paper in response to the Body Worlds exhibition. The group were largely in favour of the exhibition due to its educational goals. But the paper also discussed fears surrounding whether the exhibits educational aims were. of human remains. There were concerns over the display of plastinated fetuses due to beliefs surrounding abortion. secondary to the experience of voyeurism. In 2007 the Bishop of Manchester launched a campaign to coincide with the opening of Body Worlds. In May 2009 he unveiled a plastinate of a couple having sex intended for a Berlin exhibition. Von Hagens has maintained tight copyright control over pictures of his exhibits. Visitors were not allowed to take pictures and press photographers were banned. Government petition calling for a review of the law regarding the policies and practices of touring shows involving corpses. The Body Worlds website offers plastinated pieces for personal nonpublication use only Sale of plastinates. required to sign restrictive agreements permitting only a single publication in a defined context followed by a return of the copyright to von Hagens. There are a wide range of products from plastinated fruit jewelry to entire humans. Some of the pieces require purchasers to be a qualified user. Many pieces including animal testicles and baby chicks require no authorization. There are also extremely realistic plastinate impressions of human hearts and slices. Body Worlds has given rise to several similar shows featuring plastinated cadavers including BODIES The Exhibition and Our Body. von Hagens has asserted copyright protection and has sued Body Worlds. Some of these contain exhibits very similar to von Hagen plastinates. Suits were based on a presumed copyright of certain positions of the bodies but the counterparty asserts that the human body in its diversity cannot be copyrighted. While the Korean police in Seoul confiscated a few exhibits from Bodies Revealed the exhibition went on successfully. Bodies Revealed exhibition in Blackpool England ran from August through October 2004. Other exhibition sites in 2006 were Mexico City Atlanta Georgia US London and Las Vegas Nevada. Unlike Body Worlds none of the competing exhibitions or their suppliers have a body donation programme. Premier Exhibitions could not prove consent for the use of the bodies in its exhibitions. The Laogai Research Foundation has charged could include executed prisoners. In May 2008 a settlement with the attorney general of New York obliged Premier Exhibition to offer refunds to visitors. ""We have been able to establish that these people consented to their remains being used in this manner,"" the coroner says. ""We are able to say that they consented that their remains should be used in a manner that is respectful of them"""
