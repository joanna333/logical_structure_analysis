Axial skeleton,The axial skeleton is the core part of the endoskeleton made of the bones of the head and trunk of vertebrates. In the human skeleton it consists of 80 bones and is composed of the skull 22 bones including the mandible and the middle ear ossicles. The human axial skeleton consists of 81 different bones. It is the medial core of the body and connects the pelvis to the body where the appendix skeleton attaches. Flat bones house the brain and other vital organs. As the skeleton grows older the bones get weaker with the exception of the skull. The human skull consists of the cranium and the facial bones. The cranium holds and protects the brain in a large space called the cranial vault. The axial skeleton serves to protect the brain spinal cord heart and lungs. It also serves as the attachment site for muscles that move the head neck and back. The 22 bones that compose the skull form additional smaller spaces besides the cranial vault such as the cavities for the eyes the internal ear the nose and the mouth. The most important facial bones include the jaw or mandible the upper jaw or maxilla the zygomatic or cheek bone and the nasal bone. During development the eight separate plates of the immature bones fuse into one single structure known as the Skull. The only bone that remains separate from the rest of the skull is the mandible. The rib cages are composed of 12 pairs of ribs plus the sternum for a total of 25 separate bones. The rounded ends are attached at joints to the thoracic vertebrae at the back and the flattened ends come together at the sternum in the front. The upper seven pairs of ribs attach to the. sternum with costal cartilage and are known as true ribs. The 8th through 10th ribs have noncostal. cartilage which connects them to the ribs above and for this they are. known as false ribs The last two ribs are called floating ribs because they do not attach to other ribs and simply hang free. The first rib is the shortest broadest flattest and most curved. The length of each rib increases from number one to seven and then decreases until rib pair number 12. The two lowest vertebrae the sacrum and the coccyx are single bones made up of several smaller smaller. The vertebral column consists of 5 parts. The most cranial uppermost part is the coccyx. This is the part of the brain that contains the most of the cranial nerves. It is also the part where the brain is attached to the skull. Cervical vertebrae make up the junction between the vertebral column and the cranium. Cervical and coccygeal vertebrae are fused and thus often called sacral bone or coccygal bone as unit. Sacral bone makes up the joint between the  vertebral column and the pelvic bones. The axial skeleton consists of 80 bones. The skull contains 22 bones from which 8 are cranial and 14 are facial. The term axis means the central point around which the other structures are distributed. along the central axis of the body.
