Cancer exodus hypothesis,The cancer exodus hypothesis establishes that circulating tumor cell clusters CTC clusters maintain their multicellular structure throughout the metastatic process. Traditionally it was believed that these clusters needed to dissociate into individual cells during their journey through the bloodstream to seed secondary tumors. However recent studies show that CTC cluster can travel through bloodstream intact enabling them to perform every step of metastasis while maintaining their groupcluster structure.
