Cervical artery dissection,Cervical artery dissection is dissection of one of the layers that compose the carotid and vertebral artery in the neck cervix. Cervical dissections can be broadly classified as either spontaneous or traumatic. They include Carotid artery dissections a separation of. the layers of the artery wall supplying oxygenbearing blood to the head and brain. Vertebral artery Dissection a flaplike tear of the inner lining of the vertebral arteries that supply blood to brain and spinal cord. A cervical artery dissection typically results in a tear in one of the layers of the arterial wall. The result of this tear is often an intramural hematoma andor aneurysmal dilation in the arteries leading to the intracranial area. Signs and symptoms are often nonspecific and can be localized or generalized. Cervical artery dissection has been noted to be a common cause of young adult strokes. Some sources indicate a prevalence of up to 20 in this young adult population with annual incidence rates between 26 and 29 per 100000. In populationbased studies the peak age of presentation is approximately 45. Cervical arteries as mentioned above consist of two pairs of arteries vertebral and carotid. Cervical artery dissection can be further categorized based on the involvement of artery carotids vs vertebral. The location of the dissection intracranial vs extracranial Causes The two main causes can be broadly categorized as either spontaneous or traumatic. A tear in one of the layers of the arterial walls can result in blood collecting within a pocket between the layers. At the moment there is no definitive location for the dissection. Some believe dissection initially occurs within the connective tissue and vasa vasorum of the media. Spontaneous cervical artery dissections are dissections that occur without any trauma to the neck. This can include potential causes such as hereditary connective tissue diseases family history of strokes infections and other miscellaneous causes like smoking hypertension migraines and contraceptive use. Hereditary connective tissues diseases include autosomal polycystic kidney disease and EhlersDanlos syndrome. Traumatic cervical artery dissections are dissections that occur after any sort of trauma to the neck ranging from minor trauma such as noseblowing or sneezing to more severe trauma like roadside accidents. The link between hereditary connective tissue diseases and cervical artery dissection is low ranging from 006 to 518 in one study. Cervical artery dissections begin initially with a small tear in the innermost layer of the arterial wall. The resulting hematoma formation can either narrow stenosis or occlude the artery decreasing or completely blocking blood flow through the artery A. The brain has a pair of carotid and vertebral arteries on each side of the neck. A unilateral occlusion can be asymptomatic as the bilateral circulation continues perfusing the brain. complete occlusions of the artery can result in cerebral ischemia as the brain is depleted of oxygenrich blood. The signs and symptoms of cervical artery dissection are often nonspecific or generalized and can either develop acutely or over several days Headache Visual disturbances ie diplopia ptosis Tinnitus Neck and face pain Horner syndrome often partial Loss of taste Anosmia Unilateral weakness Stroke Imaging Various imaging modalities can be used for the diagnosis.  diagnosis of cervical artery dissection can be confirmed with the presence of a mural hematoma on ultrasound US or magnetic resonance imaging MRI. MRI with a fatsuppressed T1 sequence is often firstline imaging. Other modalities exist with helical computed topographic angiography CTA becoming the new goldstandard. The primary goal of treatment in cervical artery dissection is preventing or treating a stroke. Treatment guidelines also depend on the presence of underlying connective tissue disorders dissection secondary to trauma and underlying medical conditions. Management is often using either imaging techniques is often multifunctional. Antiplatelet drugs can be given as individual drugs or in combination ie aspirin alone or aspiring and clopidogrel. Anticoagulation such as heparin intravenously IV or injectable shot. Cervical Artery Dissection in Stroke Study CADISS examined the efficacy of antiplatelet and anticoagulating treatment. The CADISS trial revealed no significant difference in efficacy of antiplatelet and anticoagulant drugs in preventing strokes or death. strokes were rare in either group and rarer than what has been reported in observational studies. stroke or death in individuals with symptomatic dissections.
