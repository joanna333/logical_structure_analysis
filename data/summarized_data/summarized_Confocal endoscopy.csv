Confocal endoscopy,Confocal endoscopy or confocal laser endomicroscopy CLE is a modern imaging technique that allows the examination of realtime microscopic and histological features inside the body. Similar to confocal microscopy the laser in CLE filtered by the pinhole excites the fluorescent dye through a lens.  CLE can be intubated to study the gastrointestinal GI tract and accessory digestive organs with a fluorescent dye. A variety of diseases including inflammatory bowel disease IBD and Barretts oesophagus can be diagnosed by the magnified and magnified CLE.  CLE can identify the lesions with a small depths of view under the tissue in contrast to the surface level in conventional endoscopy. It also allows clinicians to discriminate benign or malignant lesions through realtime histological diagnosis by revealing the properties of the lamina at a cellular level. Schiff staining CLE identifies similar patterns of goblet cells and foamy macrophages. Two types of CLE have been invented namely probebased pCLE and endoscopebased CLE eCLE Probebased CLE pCLE developed by Mauna Kea Technologies is a fibre bundle.  eCLE developed by Pentax is a confocal microscopy fixed at the end of the endoscopic tube. The integrated machine of eCLE is larger than the pCLE in diameter making GI tract endoscopic intubation more difficult. eCLE has ceased commercially due to the cameras.  CLE is effective in detecting premalignant including Barretts oesophagus and malignant cancerous lesions in the upper GI tract. The modifications of mucosa shown in histopathology as an index of malignancy can be identified under CLE such as highgrade dysplasia.  CLE can detect early gastric cancer as well as premalignant conditions such as gastritis and intestinal metaplasia. The Miami classification was refined in 2016 to include both pit patterns and the architecture of blood vessels. The refined classification allows clinicians to differentiate between neoplastic and nonneoplastic lesions.  CLE can be utilized to identify adenoma and neoplasia in colorectal polyps and lesions. Helicobacter pylori can also be identified using CLE by viewing the morphological changes in tissues Lower Gastrointestinal Tract CLE reveals soccer balllike pattern of narrower capillaries in malignant lymphomas. IBD CLE can be used for the identification of IBD and its subtypes Crohns disease and ulcerative colitis based on the observation on morphological characteristics such as architectural distortion and crypt irregularity. It can also be used to predict IBD progression on noninflamed epithelium. EUS CLE can accurately diagnose pancreatic cystic lesions including mucinous and nonmucinous lesions. Special needles are used to collect fluid and cyst wall tissues for testing. PDAC clinicians can identify early chronic pancreatitis and determine the malignancies of lesions.  CLE captures the fluorescence produced by specific antibodies binding to vascular endothelial growth factor VEGF. adapted to differentiate cancerous and inflammatory causes Others The discrimination of inflammation and malignant tumor in lung and the urinary system may be done by using CLE and this is currently under research.  CLE can be used in a similar manner in the examination of head and neck cancer using CLE though the diagnostic targets may be different from those in the gastrointestinal tract. Comparing the significant difference in fluorescent strength clinicians can differentiate normal and neoplastic tissue. The fluorescent dye in targeted tissue is excited and emits a specific wavelength. The laser is eventually filtered by a pinhole to reduce outoffocus noise to enter the detector or photomultiplier tube. Cresyl violet and acriflavine can be used as topical dyes. Fluorescein is the most popular IV dye for CLE. Acriflavine is an antiseptic and dye. in histology used for light microscopy sections especially brain sections. In CLE it can stain the nuclei of GI surface epithelial cells. It is commonly applied topically to identify corneal diseases with slit lamp microscopes. intravenously to identify retinal diseases with angiography including macular degeneration and diabetic retinopathy. In CLE it is usually administered intravenously immediately before the intubation of an endoscopic tube. Fluorescein slowly decays up to a minimal detectable level after 1 hour giving a time window for clinicians to investigate. Research has proposed a crypt recognition algorithm which predicts the pixel. CLEs narrow field of vision makes it difficult to identify the location and path of the probe making it challenging to correspond the image obtained and the lesion location and direction. A new image quality assessment IQA utilising Webers Law and local displacement by the moving angle and distance. By restoring the exploration path of CLE clinicians can locate the sites of interest and improve diagnostic efficiency. As CLE often encounters image distortions the degradation of image quality and loss of image information increase the difficulty of accurate diagnosis.  CLE requires specific training to operate CLE and correctly interpret CLE images which are rarely used skills by experts in endoscopy. The variety of pathology conditions identifiable by CLE is limited. Owing to the narrow field of view the applications of CLE might be limited. Fluorescein is the only safe dye approved while cresyl violet and acriflavine are commonly used agents. The lack of choice of contrast agents may limit the application of CLE. Computeraided diagnosis with AI technology may be beneficial in diagnosing CLE images. CLE is mostly used in combination with other techniques instead of replacing conventional endoscopy with biopsy CLE can only serve as a complementary to the traditional biopsy. By sharing the same working channel conventional biopsy and CLE can be done alternatively by single intubation.  endoscopic techniques may give rise to pancreatitis when used to examine the pancreas. The incidence can be minimized by shortening the inspection time and avoiding excessive needle movement. Mild side effects which are rare include Nausea Vomiting with mild epigastric pain Rash at injection site. Transient hypotension without shock Diffuse erythema Cases of anaphylaxis are reported by ophthalmological uses of fluorescein. Prophylactic use of antihistamines can reduce the chances of allergic reactions. Acriflavine is potentially carcinogenic to humans due to its known mutagenic ability The dye is therefore not approved by the FDA.  CLE was invented by Marvin Minsky in 1957. Since 2004 CLE has been used for observing histopathological changes in gastrointestinal tissues. CLE was first used to observe changes in the gastrointestinal tissues in 2004. It is now being used to monitor changes in other tissues.
