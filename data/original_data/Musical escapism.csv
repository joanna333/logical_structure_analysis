Musical escapism,"Musical escapism is a psychological phenomenon characterized by the use of music to elicit vivid daydreams and imaginative scenarios, facilitating a temporary disconnection from immediate surroundings. This practice, a subset of the broader concept of escapism, involves active cognitive engagement, wherein listeners become participants in self-constructed narratives inspired by and synchronized with musical stimuli. The term was coined by Dorsa Rohani at the University of Toronto.


== Variety of daydreaming ==
Musical escapism exists on a spectrum, ranging from casual, brief episodes to more immersive, prolonged experiences.
The phenomenon primarily serves as a medium for entertainment and creative expression to cope with subconscious stressors and anxieties. However, it is not entirely confined to those seeking solace from adversity; rather, it is a diverse phenomenon with broad appeal, engaging individuals across various life circumstances and psychological states. It involves constructing vivid, imaginative scenarios synchronized with the auditory experience. These mental constructs may include self-projections, original characters, or adaptations of existing fictional entities within various contexts. The scenarios can range from purely fantastical narratives to idealized representations of real-life situations.


== Musical escapism in media ==
Musical escapism is not officially recognized as a mental disorder, and has attracted significant attention from  social media outlets since 2020. Around the same time, a trend known as ""reality shifting"" appeared on TikTok. This trend, similar to intense daydreaming and frequently set to music, became an extremely prevalent internet phenomenon.


== Musical escapism vs. maladaptive daydreaming ==
Maladaptive daydreaming is a psychological condition marked by excessive and immersive fantasies that interfere with daily functioning, leading to concentration difficulties, social withdrawal, and neglect of responsibilities. In contrast, musical escapism is a controlled psychological response to music driven by emotion and occasionally subconscious stress, typically without impairing daily life.
The primary differences between maladaptive daydreaming and musical escapism lie in the nature of the activity, degree of control, and individual impact. Maladaptive daydreaming involves uncontrollable and immersive fantasy, leading to significant functional impairment and distress, whereas musical escapism is a controlled activity that generally influences and is influenced by emotional well-being, and can have both positive and negative psychological effects.
