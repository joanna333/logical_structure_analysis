The Type Mapping System,"The Type Mapping System is an integrated set of psychological assessment tools designed to understand and describe how individuals behave and respond to various situations. It is based on C.G. Jung's theory of Psychological Types but focuses on how people manage to adapt given their underlying personality is always influenced by the requirements and constraints of their immediate situation.
The questionnaires identify behavioral patterns, situational challenges, personal preferences, and personal aspirations for development by introducing a neglected psychological element – the ‘Ideal Self’. The system provides a flexible, integrated approach to developing behavioural flexibility and Emotional Intelligence (EI) through a better understanding of the impact of a person's behavior on the environment and others.


== History and development ==
The system was developed and first published in 2004 by Team Focus Limited. It draws heavily on the work of Swiss psychologist Carl Jung, particularly his theory of Psychological Types, which is also the foundation of the widely used Myers–Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI). However, it takes a more dynamic view of personality which is more in tune with Jung's original theory which emphasises how people change and grow.


== Theoretical foundation ==
The system is based on Jung's psychological type theory, which identifies some basic cognitive functions and preferences which are often represented by four-letter codes (e.g., ESTJ, INFP), which are also used in the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator.
Unlike the MBTI, the system goes beyond personality typing by incorporating situational analysis and the dynamic interaction between personal preferences and external demands. This allows it to address specific behavioral challenges in different contexts, whether personal or professional.


== Components of the system ==
The system uses a set of tools and questionnaires to analyze behavior, preferences, and situational challenges:
1. Ideal Task Profile Questionnaire (ITPQ™)
The ITPQ™ is used to analyze current situational challenges, allowing individuals or teams to evaluate the demands of their environment
2. Managing Team Roles Indicator (MTR-i™)
The MTR-i™ assesses the roles and behaviors exhibited by individuals or teams in various contexts. It helps identify how people contribute and interact within a group setting.
3. Type Dynamics Indicator (TDI®)
The TDI® comes in two versions, the ""Is"" and the ""Want"" versions. The ""Is"" version identifies a person's habitual preferences, while the ""Want"" version reveals aspirations and potential stress points when there are mismatches between preferences and situational demands


== Application(s) ==
The system can be applied in various fields, including organizational development, coaching, and leadership training. By using the system's tools, individuals and teams can gain insights into their behavior, adapt to external challenges, and develop strategies for personal and professional growth.
Emotional Intelligence (EI) and building stronger relationships
One key application of the system is the development of Emotional Intelligence which is often seen as a pre-requisite for building strong relationships – both at work and elsewhere. By understanding people's personal preferences and styles it helps develop Personal Emotional Intelligence from Relational Intelligence and Situational Intelligence. This helps individuals to recognize and manage their emotions and behaviour in different social settings.


== Comparisons with other systems ==
The system shares similarities with the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator but is distinct in its focus on both behavior and context. It integrates Jung's psychological theories with practical tools for real-world application, making it a comprehensive system for personal and professional development.


== Criticism and limitations ==
While the system has been recognized for its dynamic approach to personality and situational analysis, critics argue that its complexity might make it difficult to use without proper training. Additionally, some critics of Jungian-based systems argue that his approach categorises individuals into fixed types which may oversimplify the complexities of human behavior. The Type Mapping system attempts to reduce the risk of this being done
