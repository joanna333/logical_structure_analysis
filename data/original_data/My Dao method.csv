My Dao method,"The My Dao method (the psychological transformation game) is a psychotherapeutic method that influences value orientations, changes in self-esteem and motivation, and the disclosure of personal resources for problem solving and further human development.


== History ==
In 2014 Professor Melnyk Yuriy Borysovych, Psychologist, PhD in education, and Affiliated Associate Professor Stadnik Anatoliy Volodymyrovych, Psychiatrist, PhD in medicine, who had many years of practical experience as well as research and teaching experience at Kharkiv National Pedagogical University, National Academy of the National Guard of Ukraine, and Scientific Research Institute KRPOCH, proposed a method of psychotherapy that was later classified as the psychological transformation game My Dao (hereinafter referred to as ""My Dao"").


== Methodology ==
The ""My Dao"" methodology is a complex intertwining of psychological approaches, theories and techniques, including:

the psychoanalytic approach to the analysis of the player's personality through the study of psychological ego defence mechanisms and the use of psychoanalytic techniques;
the analytical approach to the analysis of complexes and the unconscious through the choice and interpretation of the choice of game pieces by players;
the transactional analysis (structural analysis, transactional analysis, game analysis, scenario analysis) to study the interaction of players in communication, accompanied by the presentation of their positions;
the Gestalt approach to the interpretation and discussion of picture cards and stimulus cards carried out by participants in the game;
the individual approach to the analysis of life goals and lifestyle at different age stages (game zones) of players;
the activity and body-oriented approach to the analysis of behaviour and nonverbal actions of players that they perform during the game.


== Principles ==
The important starting points and key principles of the ""My Dao"" method are:

the principle of neutrality;
the principle of equal position;
the principle of unity of decision and action.


== Method ==
The aim of ""My Dao"" is to explore participants' self-esteem and motivation, and to reveal their personal resources for problem-solving and development.
The target group of ""My Dao"" is clients with a fairly wide age range – from young people (from 17 years old) to the elderly – and a wide range of deep personal problems. It can be used with individuals in non-clinical and clinical psychotherapy.
The toolkit of ""My Dao"" consists of 1) 12 figures, animal symbols; 2) 108 picture cards; 3) 36 incentive (motivation) cards; 4) dice; 5) game board.


=== My Dao process ===
The ""My Dao"" game is divided into three stages: preparatory, main and final.

The preparatory stage: The host gives instructions to the participants, introduces them to the rules of the game, the aim of the game, draws lots, etc.
The main stage: Players take turns rolling the dice and making a move for a set number of points. They take a picture card from a particular column and describe their associations with the card, answering any questions from the facilitator and participants. After answering, players take a motivator card and answer the host's questions.
Participants pass through all three sectors: first yellow (play), then green (learn) and red (work). They continue to make moves describing the associations of the picture cards received and the motivator cards received/selected.

The final stage: Summary of the results by the participants and the host. Participants analyse their life's achievements and link them to the cards they have collected during the game.


== Effectiveness ==
The Schwartz method of diagnosing value orientations (adapted by Karandashev) was used to test the effectiveness of ""My Dao"", which is used to study the dynamics of changing values in groups and individuals in relation to their life problems.
The effectiveness of ""My Dao"" depends on the age of the participants, the ""maturity"" of the functional systems of the nervous system, the degree and stage of the psychological disorders and the duration of the therapy. The most significant impact of ""My Dao"" on participants is observed at the level of normative ideals: tradition, conformity, security, hedonism and universalism. This indicates a certain change in them towards greater harmony and stability, as well as a decrease in humility and acceptance of their fate. At the level of individual priorities, there is an increase in hedonism, power and stimulation, indicating a growing role for pleasure, success, ambition, novelty and deep experience. The high scores for universalism, hedonism, autonomy and conformity indicate an increase in understanding, tolerance, enjoyment of life, self-control, self-government, self-discipline and politeness among the participants.


== Criticism ==
Psychological transformation games can be attributed to the field of alternative medicine. For the period 2018–2023, a number of experimental studies have been conducted on the ""My Dao"" method. This methodology has been used and recommended in studies. The use of the ""My Dao"" method proves its effectiveness. However, according to the authors, psychotherapeutic effects in older people with different mental illnesses remain under-researched in clinical settings.
