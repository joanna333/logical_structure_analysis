RNU4-2 syndrome,"RNU4-2 Syndrome or ReNU syndrome is a neurodevelopmental disorder caused by de novo variants in the human gene RNU4-2, which encodes an RNA component of the major spliceosome. It is characterized by hypotonia, global developmental delay, severely impaired intellectual development with poor or absent speech, delayed walking or inability to walk, feeding difficulties with poor overall growth, dysmorphic facial features, and brain anomalies, including ventriculomegaly.
RNU4-2 / ReNU syndrome is one of the most prevalent monogenic neurodevelopmental disorders, with variants in RNU4-2 estimated to account for around 0.4% of all neurodevelopmental disorders. The syndrome is an autosomal dominant genetic disorder caused by de novo variants in RNU4-2, a gene on chromosome 12, which encodes the small nuclear RNA (snRNA) U4. U4 is a component of the major spliceosome, a complex of proteins and non-coding RNAs that is necessary for RNA splicing. Most cases of RNU4-2 / ReNU syndrome are explained by a 1-bp insertion (n.64_65insT, NR_003137.2), which is thought to disrupt the interactions of snRNA U4 with the snRNA U6, affecting the stability of the ACAGAGA loop of U6 sRNA which binds 5' splice sites and induces splicing after U4-U6 unwinding. Disrupted splicing, in particular a change in 5' splice site usage, has been reported in individuals with variants in RNU4-2.
The genetic etiology of RNU4-2 / ReNU syndrome was first described in a preprint in April 2024. It was subsequently published by two research teams independently, both who used data collected by Genomics England. One team, led by the English statistician Daniel Greene working at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, used a Bayesian analysis. The other team involved a global collaboration led by Yuyang Chen and Nicola Whiffin of the University of Oxford.
Neurodevelopmental disorder with hypotonia, brain anomalies, distinctive facies, and absent language (NEDHAFA) was a suggested name for this syndrome, however, ReNU syndrome (pronounced 'renew') was chosen through a collaboration between researchers and the families of those impacted by variants in RNU4-2. The name symbolises that this diagnosis “renews” hope for a brighter future for all those affected.
