Oncology,Oncology is a branch of medicine that deals with the study treatment diagnosis and prevention of cancer A medical professional who practices oncology is an oncologist The names etymological origin is the Greek word ὄγκος ónkos meaning tumor volume or mass Oncology is concerned with The diagnosis of any cancer in a person pathology Therapy eg surgery chemotherapy radiotherapy and other modalities Followup of cancer patients after successful treatment Palliative care of patients with terminal malignancies Ethical questions surrounding cancer care Screening efforts of populations or of the relatives of patients in types of cancer that are thought to have a hereditary basis such as breast cancer  Diagnosis  Medical histories remain an important screening tool the character of the complaints and nonspecific symptoms such as fatigue weight loss unexplained anemia fever of unknown origin paraneoplastic phenomena and other signs may warrant further investigation for malignancy Occasionally a physical examination may find the location of a malignancy Diagnostic methods include Biopsy or resection these are methods by which suspicious neoplastic growths can be removed in part or in whole and evaluated by a pathologist to determine malignancy This is currently the gold standard for the diagnosis of cancer and is crucial in guiding the next step in management active surveillance surgery radiation therapy chemotherapy or a combination of these Endoscopy either upper or lower gastrointestinal cystoscopy bronchoscopy or nasendoscopy to localise areas suspicious for malignancy and biopsy when necessary Mammograms Xrays CT scanning MRI scanning ultrasound and other radiological techniques to localise and guide biopsy Scintigraphy single photon emission computed tomography SPECT positron emission tomography PET and other methods of nuclear medicine to identify areas suspicious of malignancy Blood tests including tumor markers which can increase the suspicion of certain types of cancers Apart from diagnoses these modalities especially imaging by CT scanning are often used to determine operability ie whether it is surgically possible to remove a tumor in its entirety Currently a tissue diagnosis from a biopsy by a pathologist is essential for the proper classification of cancer and to guide the next step of treatment On extremely rare instances when this is not possible empirical therapy without an exact diagnosis may be considered based on the available evidence eg history xrays and scans On very rare occasions a metastatic lump or pathological lymph node is found typically in the neck for which a primary tumor cannot be found However immunohistochemical markers often give a strong indication of the primary malignancy This situation is referred to as malignancy of unknown primary and again treatment is empirically based on past experience of the most likely origin  Therapy  Depending upon the cancer identified followup and palliative care will be administered at that time Certain disorders such as ALL or AML will require immediate admission and chemotherapy while others will be followed up with regular physical examination and blood tests Often surgery is attempted to remove a tumor entirely This is only feasible when there is some degree of certainty that the tumor can in fact be removed When it is certain that parts will remain curative surgery is often impossible eg when there are metastases or when the tumor has invaded a structure that cannot be operated upon without risking the patients life Occasionally surgery can improve survival even if not all tumour tissue has been removed the procedure is referred to as debulking ie reducing the overall amount of tumour tissue Surgery is also used for the palliative treatment of some cancers eg to relieve biliary obstruction or to relieve the problems associated with some cerebral tumors The risks of surgery must be weighed against the benefits Chemotherapy and radiotherapy are used as a firstline radical therapy in several malignancies They are also used for adjuvant therapy ie when the macroscopic tumor has already been completely removed surgically but there is a reasonable statistical risk that it will recur Chemotherapy and radiotherapy are commonly used for palliation where disease is clearly incurable in this situation the aim is to improve the quality of life and to prolong it Hormone manipulation is well established particularly in the treatment of breast and prostate cancer There is currently a rapid expansion in the use of monoclonal antibody treatments notably for lymphoma Rituximab and breast cancer Trastuzumab Vaccines and other immunotherapies are the subject of intensive research  Palliative care  Approximately 50 of all cancer cases in the Western world can be treated to remission with radical treatment For pediatric patients that number is much higher A large number of cancer patients will die from the disease and a significant proportion of patients with incurable cancer will die of other causes There may be ongoing issues with symptom control associated with progressive cancer and also with the treatment of the disease These problems may include pain nausea anorexia fatigue immobility and depression Not all issues are strictly physical personal dignity may be affected Moral and spiritual issues are also important While many of these problems fall within the remit of the oncologist palliative care has matured into a separate closely allied specialty to address the problems associated with advanced disease Palliative care is an essential part of the multidisciplinary cancer care team Palliative care services may be less hospitalbased than oncology with nurses and doctors who are able to visit the patient at home  Ethical issues  There are a number of recurring ethical questions and dilemmas in oncological practice These include What information to give the patient regarding disease extentprogressionprognosis Entry into clinical trials especially in the face of terminal illness Withdrawal of active treatment Do Not Resuscitate orders and other endoflife issues These issues are closely related to the patients personality religion culture and family life Though these issues are complex and emotional the answers are often achieved by the patient seeking counsel from trusted personal friends and advisors It requires a degree of sensitivity and very good communication on the part of the oncology team to address these problems properly  Progress and research  There is a tremendous amount of research being conducted on all frontiers of oncology ranging from cancer cell biology and radiation therapy to chemotherapy treatment regimens and optimal palliative care and pain relief Nextgeneration sequencing and wholegenome sequencing have completely changed the understanding of cancers Identification of novel geneticmolecular markers will change the methods of diagnosis and treatment paving the way for personalized medicine Therapeutic trials often involve patients from many different hospitals in a particular region In the UK patients are often enrolled in large studies coordinated by Cancer Research UK CRUK Medical Research Council MRC the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer EORTC or the National Cancer Research Network NCRN The most valued companies worldwide whose leading products are in Oncology include Pfizer United States Roche Switzerland Merck United States AstraZeneca United Kingdom Novartis Switzerland and BristolMyers Squibb United States who are active in the treatment areas Kinase inhibitors Antibodies Immunooncology and Radiopharmaceuticals  Specialties  The four main divisions Medical oncology
