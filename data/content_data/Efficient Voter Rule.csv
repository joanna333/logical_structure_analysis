Efficient Voter Rule,In the study of voter behavior the efficient voter rule speaks to the desirability of voterdriven outcomes It applies to situations involving negative externalities such as pollution and crime and positive externalities such as education Related efforts to achieve socially optimal quantities of externalities have long been a focus of microeconomic research most famously by Ronald Coase and Arthur Pigou Externality problems persist despite past remedies which makes newer approaches such as the efficient voter rule important In the context of negative externalities the efficient voter rule states that when individuals who receive the same harm from a problem vote on whether to eliminate that problem at a uniform cost per individual the outcome will be efficient regardless of each individuals contribution to the problem The Rule applies similarly to positive externalities as exemplified by the solar panel example below The efficient voter rule indicates that voting on a collective action or policy change should lead to an efficient outcome Possible applications include policy decisions about clean energy noise pollution overfishing mandatory immunizations smoking bans zoning septic systems and fuel economy standards In the context of crime recent applications include votes on the strict enforcement of traffic laws The vote in Tucson Arizona on whether to use cameras to catch drivers who run red lights provides one example The community voted against this strict level of enforcement According to the efficient voter rule this outcome indicates that community members collectively received a greater benefit from occasionally skirting the law than from protection from malfeasance The literature explains why the efficient voter rule applies even if individuals cause differing levels of damage and if a given amount of damage from each individual is completely external  Example  Consider a policy proposal to require each of the 100 households in an economy to rent a solar panel that costs 400 per year net of the value of the energy provided to the user Suppose each panel would prevent 600 worth of harm from pollution in the economy each year The pollution is uniformly distributed so each of the 100 households incurs 1100  600  6 worth of the harm that could be avoided by each panel yearly Although societys 600 annual benefit from each panel exceeds the 400 annual cost each household only internalizes 6 worth of the environmental benefitfar less than the rental cost of a panel So the privately optimal decision is to not rent a panel To reach the socially optimal decision residents could vote on the policy proposal If enacted the policy would cost each household 400 per year The total damage each household would avoid each year if the policy were enactedthe households annual benefit from policy enactmentwould be 100 x 6  600 So the voting mechanism causes each household to internalize the entire 600 yearly benefit to society of purchasing a panel and the incentive is for households to vote in favor of the socially optimal policy Suppose instead that each panel would prevent only 300 worth of harm from pollution in the economy each year again spread uniformly among 100 homes In that case it would not be socially optimal for residents to purchase panels because the 400 annual cost would exceed the 300 annual benefit Again a vote would yield the socially optimal solution If the policy were implemented each resident would avoid its 1100 x 300  3 share of the harm from each of 100 panels yearly but this 300 benefit would fall below the 400 annual cost of a panel so each resident would vote against the requirement and collectively the community would achieve the socially optimal outcome
