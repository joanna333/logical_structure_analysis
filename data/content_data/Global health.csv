Global health,Global health is the health of populations in a worldwide context it has been defined as the area of study research and practice that places a priority on improving health and achieving equity in health for all people worldwide Problems that transcend national borders or have a global political and economic impact are often emphasized Thus global health is about worldwide health improvement including mental health reduction of disparities and protection against global threats that disregard national borders including the most common causes of human death and years of life lost from a global perspective Global health is not to be confused with international health which is defined as the branch of public health focusing on developing nations and foreign aid efforts by industrialized countries One way that global health can be measured is through the prevalence of various global diseases in the world and their threat to decrease life expectancy in the present day Estimates suggest that in a premodern poor world life expectancy was around 30 years in all regions of the world mainly due to high infant mortality Another holistic perspective called One Health can be used to address global health challenges and to improve global health security The predominant agency associated with global health and international health is the World Health Organization WHO Other important agencies impacting global health include UNICEF and World Food Programme WFP The United Nations system has also played a part in crosssectoral actions to address global health and its underlying socioeconomic determinants with the declaration of the Millennium Development Goals and the more recent Sustainable Development Goals  Definition  Global health employs several perspectives that focus on the determinants and distribution of health in international contexts Medicine describes the pathology of diseases and promotes prevention diagnosis and treatment Public health emphasizes the health of populations Epidemiology helps identify risk factors and causes of health problems Demography provides data for policy decisions Economics emphasizes the costeffectiveness and costbenefit approaches for the optimal allocation of health resources Other social sciences such as sociology development studies psychology anthropology cultural studies and law can help understand the determinants of health in societies Both individuals and organizations working in the domain of global health often face many questions regarding ethical and human rights Critical examination of the various causes and justifications of health inequities is necessary for the success of proposed solutions Such issues are discussed at the biannual Global Summits of National EthicsBioethics Councils  History  Global health as a discipline is widely acknwoledged to be of imperial origin and the need for its decolonisation has been widely recognised The global health ecosystem has also been criticised as having a feudal structure acting for a small group of institutions and individuals based in highincome countries which acts similar to an imperial Crown Some key leaders of the decolonising global health movement are Seye Abimbola and Madhukar Pai Important steps were taken towards global cooperation in health with the formation of the United Nations UN and the World Bank Group in 1945 after World War II In 1948 the member states of the newly formed United Nations gathered to create the World Health Organization A cholera epidemic that took 20000 lives in Egypt in 1947 and 1948 helped spur the international community to action The WHO published its Model List of Essential Medicines and the 1978 Alma Ata declaration underlined the importance of primary health care At a United Nations Summit in 2000 member nations declared eight Millennium Development Goals MDGs which reflected the major challenges facing human development globally to be achieved by 2015 The declaration was matched by unprecedented global investment by donor and recipient countries According to the UN these MDGs provided an important framework for development and significant progress has been made in a number of areas However progress has been uneven and some of the MDGs were not fully realized including maternal newborn and child health and reproductive health Building on the MDGs a new Sustainable Development Agenda with 17 Sustainable Development Goals SDGs has been established for the years 20162030 The first goal being an ambitious and historic pledge to end poverty On 25 September 2015 the 193 countries of the UN General Assembly adopted the 2030 Development Agenda titled Transforming our world the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development Several major initiatives began in the 2000s including the vaccine alliance GAVI in 2000 The Global Fund to Fight AIDS Tuberculosis and Malaria in 2002 US Presidents Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief in 2003 and the US Presidents Malaria Initiative in 2005 In this decade and as part of the Monterrey Consensus which did not pursue goals as aggressively as many activists had urged an increasing emphasis was put on measuring improvement in health outcomes rather than merely the amount of money spent In 2015 a book titled To Save Humanity was published with nearly 100 essays regarding todays most pressing global health issues The essays were authored by global figures in politics science and advocacy ranging from Bill Clinton to Peter Piot and addressed a wide range of issues including vaccinations antimicrobial resistance health coverage tobacco use research methodology climate change equity access to medicine and media coverage of health research  Measures  Measures of global health include disabilityadjusted life year DALY qualityadjusted life years QALYs and mortality rate  Disabilityadjusted life years  The DALY is a summary measure that combines the impact of illness disability and mortality by measuring the time lived with disability and the time lost due to premature mortality One DALY can be thought of as one lost year of healthy life The DALY for a disease is the sum of the years of life lost due to premature mortality and the years lost due to disability for incident cases of the health condition  Qualityadjusted life years  QALYs combine expected survival with expected quality of life into a single number if an additional year of healthy life is worth a value of one year then a year of less healthy life is worth less than one year QALY calculations are based on measurements of the value that individuals place on expected years of survival Measurements can be made in several ways by techniques that replicate gambles about preferences for alternative states of health with surveys or analyses that infer willingness to pay for alternative states of health or through instruments that are based on trading off some or all likely survival time that a medical intervention might provide in order to gain less survival time of higher quality  Infant and child mortality  Infant mortality and child mortality for children under age 5 are more specific than DALYs or QALYs in representing the health in the poorest sections of a population and are thus especially useful when focusing on health equity added section  Morbidity  Morbidity measures include incidence rate prevalence and cumulative incidence with incidence rate referring to the risk of developing a new health condition within a specified period of time Although sometimes loosely expressed simply as the number of new cases during a time period morbidity is better expressed as a proportion or a rate  Health topics   Infectious diseases   Respiratory tract infections  Infections of the respiratory tract and middle ear are major causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide Some respiratory infections of global significance include tuberculosis measles influenza coronaviruses and pneumonias caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis Morbillivirus Haemophilus influenzae and Pneumococci respectively The spread of respiratory infections is exacerbated by crowded conditions and poverty is associated with more than a 20fold increase in the relative burden of lung infections  Diarrheal illnesses  Diarrhea is the second most common cause of child mortality worldwide responsible for 17 of deaths of children under age 5 Poor sanitation can increase transmission of bacteria and viruses through water food utensils hands and flies Dehydration due to diarrhea can be effectively treated through oral rehydration therapy with dramatic reductions in mortality Important nutritional measures include the promotion of breastfeeding and zinc supplementation While hygienic measures alone may be insufficient for the prevention of rotavirus diarrhea it can be prevented by a safe and potentially costeffective vaccine  HIVAIDS  The HIVAIDS epidemic has highlighted the global nature of human health and welfare and globalization has given rise to a trend toward finding common solutions to global health challenges Numerous international funds have been set up in recent times to address global health challenges such as HIV Since the beginning of the epidemic more than 70 million people have been infected with the HIV virus and about 35 million people have died of HIV Globally 369 million 311439 million people were living with HIV at the end of 2017 An estimated 08 0609 of adults aged 1549 years worldwide are living with HIV although the burden of the epidemic continues to vary considerably between countries and regions The WHO African region remains most severely affected with nearly 1 in every 25 adults 41 living with HIV and accounting for nearly twothirds of the people living with HIV worldwide Human immunodeficiency virus HIV is transmitted through unprotected sex unclean needles blood transfusions and from mother to child during birth or lactation Globally HIV is primarily spread through sexual intercourse The riskperexposure with vaginal sex in lowincome countries from female to male is 038 and male to female is 03 The infection damages the immune system leading to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome AIDS and eventually death Antiretroviral drugs prolong life and delay the onset of AIDS by minimizing the amount of HIV in the body  Malaria  Malaria is a mosquitoborne infectious disease caused by the parasites of the genus Plasmodium Symptoms may include fever headaches chills muscle aches and nausea Each year there are approximately 500 million cases of malaria worldwide most commonly among children and pregnant women in developing countries The WHO African Region carries a disproportionately high share of the global malaria burden In 2016 the region was home to 90 of malaria cases and 91 of malaria deaths The use of insecticidetreated bed nets is a costeffective way to reduce deaths from malaria as is prompt artemisininbased combination therapy supported by intermittent preventive therapy in pregnancy International travelers to endemic zones are advised chemoprophylaxis with antimalarial drugs like Atovaquoneproguanil doxycycline or mefloquine Global consumption and international trade in deforestationassociated commodities could also indirectly influence malaria risk Many primary commodities cause deforestation and deforestation can increase malaria transmission Consumption of such commodities in developed nations could increase malaria risk in developing nations  Bacterial pathogens  A GBD study reported global estimates of death rates from 33 bacterial pathogens finding such infections are contributing to one in 8 deaths or 77 million deaths which could make it the second largest cause of death globally in 2019  Neglected tropical diseases  More than one billion people were treated for at least one neglected tropical disease in 2015 For instance neglected tropical diseases are a diverse group of infectious diseases that are endemic in tropical and subtropical regions of 149 countries primarily effecting low and middle income populations in Africa Asia and Latin America They are variously caused by bacteria trachoma leprosy viruses dengue rabies protozoa human African trypanosomiasis chagas and helminths schistosomiasis onchocerciasis Soil transmitted helminths The Global Burden of Disease Study concluded that neglected tropical diseases comprehensively contributed to approximately 2606 million disabilityadjusted life years in 2010 as well as significant deleterious economic effects In 2011 the World Health Organization launched a 2020 Roadmap for neglected tropical diseases aiming for the control or elimination of 10 common diseases The 2012 London Declaration builds on this initiative and called on endemic countries and the international community to improve access to clean water and basic sanitation improved living conditions vector control and health education to reach the 2020 goals In 2017 a WHO report cited unprecedented progress against neglected tropical diseases since 2007 especially due to mass drug administration of drugs donated by pharmaceutical companies  Pandemic prevention and preparedness  Pandemics have an impact on global health  Health research and development  The global health approach could foster international collaboration in medical research and development and share of its results such as vaccines optimizing overall global health for citizens The US Agency for International Developments new Global Health Research and Development Strategy 20232028 includes plans to coordinate with such stakeholders in support of innovative global health product development and work with other agencies like the CDC and National Institutes of Health Another approach to health would be the innovation of vaccines The Washington Post reported the US governments new five billion dollar budget on vaccines to prevent Covid variants because the Vaccines access and publicprivate partnerships are important Often the relevance of mechanisms to stimulate research and development is limited by national scopes and by the transnational nature of the problem which asks for an international approach Financing models creation of evidencebased recommendations and logistics may be part of that  Maternal health  Complications of pregnancy and childbirth are the leading causes of death among women of reproductive age In many developing countries a woman dies from complications from childbirth approximately every minute According to the World Health Organizations 2005 World Health Report poor maternal conditions are the fourth leading cause of death for women worldwide after HIVAIDS malaria and tuberculosis Most maternal deaths and injuries can be prevented and such deaths have been largely eradicated in the developed world Targets for improving maternal health include increasing and assisting the number of deliveries accompanied by skilled birth attendants 68 lowincome countries tracked by the WHO and UNICEFled collaboration Countdown to 2015 are estimated to hold for 97 of worldwide maternal and child deaths  Nutrition  In 2010 about 104 million children were underweight and undernutrition contributes to about one third of child deaths around the world Undernutrition is not to be confused with malnutrition which refers to poor proportion of food intake and can thus refer to obesity Undernutrition impairs the immune system increasing the frequency severity and duration of infections including measles pneumonia and diarrhea Infection can further contribute to malnutrition Deficiencies of micronutrients such as vitamin A iron iodine and zinc are common worldwide and can compromise intellectual potential growth development and adult productivity Interventions to prevent malnutrition include micronutrient supplementation fortification of basic grocery foods dietary diversification hygienic measures to reduce spread of infections and the promotion of breastfeeding  Noncommunicable diseases  Approximately 80 of deaths linked to noncommunicable diseases occur in developing countries For instance urbanization and aging have led to increasing poor health conditions related to noncommunicable diseases in India Similarly Chinas rapid urbanization and modernization have been associated with increased sedentary lifestyles contributing to the rise in NCDs in the region The fastestgrowing causes of disease burden over the last 26 years were diabetes rate increased by 80 and ischemic heart disease up 34 More than 60 of deaths about 61 million in 2016 were due to NCDs up from about 38 in 1990 Increases in refugee urbanization has led to a growing number of people diagnosed with chronic noncommunicable diseases In September 2011 the United Nations is hosting its first General Assembly Special Summit on the issue of noncommunicable diseases Noting that noncommunicable diseases are the cause of some 35 million deaths each year the international community is being increasingly called to take measures for the prevention and control of chronic diseases and mitigate their impacts on the world population especially on women who are usually the primary caregivers For example the rate of type 2 diabetes associated with obesity has been on the rise in countries previously troubled by hunger In lowincome countries the number of individuals with diabetes is expected to increase from 84 million to 228 million by 2030 Obesity a preventable condition is associated with numerous chronic diseases including cardiovascular conditions stroke certain cancers and respiratory disease About 16 of the global burden of disease measured as DALYs has been accounted for by obesity Considering that 360 million people across the world live with disabling hearing loss including 32 million children and nearly 180 million older adults and that chronic ear diseases such as chronic suppurative otitis media can lead to hearing loss and may cause lifethreatening complications the seventieth World Health Assembly on May 31 2017 signed the resolution WHA7013 Agenda item 158 urging member states to integrate strategies for ear and hearing care within the framework of their primary health care systems under the umbrella of universal health coverage A World Report on Hearing WRH was published in response to the resolution WHA7013 to provide guidance for Member States to integrate ear and hearing care into their national health plans  Lifestyle diseases  Commercial determinants of health refers to private sector activities that affect peoples health positively or negatively such as advertisements for unhealthy food  Healthrelated largest causes of death   Violence against women  Violence against women has been defined as physical sexual and psychological violence occurring in the family and in the general community including battering sexual abuse dowryrelated violence rape female genital mutilation and other traditional practices harmful to women nonspousal violence and violence related to exploitation sexual harassment and intimidation at work in educational institutions and elsewhere trafficking in women forced prostitution and violence perpetrated or condoned by the state In addition to causing injury violence may increase womens longterm risk of a number of other health problems including chronic pain physical disability drug and alcohol abuse and depression The WHO Report on global and regional estimates on violence against women found that partner abuse causes women to have 16 more chances of suffering miscarriages 41 more occurrences of preterm birth babies and twice the likeliness of having abortions and acquiring HIV or other STDs Although statistics can be difficult to obtain as many cases go unreported it is estimated that one in every five women faces some form of violence during her lifetime in some cases leading to serious injury or even death Risk factors for being an offender include low education past exposure to child maltreatment or witnessing violence between parents harmful use of alcohol attitudes accepting of violence and gender inequality Equality of women has been addressed in the Millennium Development Goals Now gender equality is Sustainable Development Goal 5 Preventing the violence against women needs to form an essential part of the public health reforms in the form of advocation and evidence gathering Primary prevention in the form of raising women economic empowerment facilities microfinance and skills training social projects related to gender equality should be conducted Activities promoting relationship and communication skills among couples reducing alcohol access and altering societal ideologies should be organized Childhood interventions community and schoolbased education raising mediaoriented awareness and other approaches should be carried out to challenge social norms and stereotypical thought processes to promote behavioral change among men and raise gender equality Trained health care providers would play a vital role in secondary and tertiary prevention of abuse by performing early identification of women suffering from violence and contributing to the addressing of their health and psychological needs They could be highly important in prevention of the recurrence of violence and the mitigation of its effects on the health of the abused women and their children The Member States of the World Health Assembly endorsed a plan in 2016 for reinforcing the health systems role in addressing the global phenomenon of violence against women and girls and working towards their health and protection  Global surgery  Halfdan T Mahler the 3rd DirectorGeneral of the World Health Organization WHO first brought attention to the disparities in surgery and surgical care when he stated the vast majority of the worlds population has no access whatsoever to skilled surgical care and little is being done to find a solution While significant progresses have been made in fields within global health such as infectious diseases maternal and child health and even other noncommunicable diseases over the past several decades the provision of surgery and surgical care in resourcelimited settings have largely remained unmet with about 5 billion people lacking access to safe and affordable surgical and anesthesia care This is especially true in the poorest countries which account for over onethird of the population but only 35 of all surgeries that occur worldwide In fact it has been estimated that up to 30 of the total global burden of disease GBD could be attributable to surgical conditions which include a mix of injuries malignancies congenital anomalies and complications of pregnancy As a result global surgery has become an emerging field within global health as the multidisciplinary enterprise of providing improved and equitable surgical care to the worlds population with its core belief as the issues of need access and quality and has often been described as the neglected stepchild of global health a term coined by Dr Paul Farmer to highlight the urgent need for further work in this area Furthermore Jim Young Kim the former President of the World Bank proclaimed in 2014 that surgery is an indivisible indispensable part of health care and of progress towards universal health coverage In 2015 the Lancet Commission on Global Surgery LCoGS published the landmark report titled Global Surgery 2030 evidence and solutions for achieving health welfare and economic development describing the large preexisting burden of surgical diseases in low and middleincome countries LMICs and future directions for increasing universal access to safe surgery by the year 2030 The Commission highlighted that 143 million additional procedures were needed every year to prevent further morbidity and mortality from treatable surgical conditions as well as a 123 trillion loss in economic productivity by the year 2030 It emphasized the need to significantly improve the capacity for Bellwether procedures  laparotomy caesarean section open fracture care  which are considered a minimum level of care that firstlevel hospitals should be able to provide in order to capture the most basic emergency surgical care In order to address these challenges and track progress the Commission defined the following core indicators for assessing access to safe and affordable surgical d anesthesia care Meeting these goals by the year 2030 would require increases in anesthetists obstetricians surgeons nurses and facilities with operating rooms as well as pre and postsurgical care capacities Data from WHO and the World Bank indicate that scaling up infrastructure to enable access to surgical care in regions where it is currently limited or is nonexistent is a lowcost measure relative to the significant morbidity and mortality caused by lack of surgical treatment In fact a systematic review found that the costeffectiveness ratio  dollars spent per DALYs averted  for surgical interventions is on par or exceeds those of major public health interventions such as oral rehydration therapy breastfeeding promotion and even HIVAIDS antiretroviral therapy This finding challenged the common misconception that surgical care is financially prohibitive endeavor not worth pursuing in LMICs In terms of the financial impact on the patients the lack of adequate surgical and anesthesia care has resulted in 33 million individuals every year facing catastrophic health expenditure  the outofpocket healthcare cost exceeding 40 of a given households income In alignment with the LCoGS call for action the World Health Assembly adopted the resolution WHA6815 in 2015 that stated Strengthening emergency and essential surgical care and anesthesia as a component of universal health coverage This not only mandated the WHO to prioritize strengthening the surgical and anesthesia care globally but also led to governments of the member states recognizing the urgent need for increasing capacity in surgery and anesthesia Additionally the third edition of Disease Control Priorities DCP3 published in 2015 by the World Bank declared surgery as essential and featured an entire volume dedicated to building surgical capacity A key policy framework that arose from this renewed global commitment towards surgical care worldwide is the National Surgical Obstetric and Anesthesia Plan NSOAP NSOAP focuses on policytoaction capacity building for surgical care with tangible steps as follows 1 analysis of baseline indicators 2 partnership with local champions 3 broad stakeholder engagement 4 consensus building and synthesis of ideas 5 language refinement 6 costing 7 dissemination and 8 implementation This approach has been widely adopted and has served as guiding principles between international collaborators and local institutions and governments Successful implementations have allowed for sustainability in terms of longterm monitoring quality improvement and continued political and financial support  The NIHR Global Health Research Unit on Global Surgery  Seven surgical research Hubs in Benin Ghana India Mexico Nigeria Rwanda and South Africa with an extensive network of urban and rural Spoke hospitals have joined to create the NIHR The NIHR Global Health Research Unit on Global Surgery is led by the University of Birmingham which provides overall oversight in relation to the Unit strategy infrastructure and delivery research and finance The network prioritized surgical topics that needed research and has performed multiple surgical studies The network resulted in many research groups including GlobalSurg I II III and COVIDSurg and many other trials with worldwide collaborations as project FALCON and CHEETAH The research was published in over 40 articles in high impact journals in topics like surgical site infections COVID19 and mortality  Other global surgery collaborations  More trials have emerged to assess surgical outcomes around the World using big data from thousands of centers Other notable trials include Global PaedSurg The study was published in The Lancet examined the risk of mortality for nearly 4000 babies born with birth defects in 264 hospitals around the world The study found babies born with birth defects involving the intestinal tract have a two in five chance of dying in a lowincome country compared to one in five in a middleincome country and one in twenty in a highincome country APORG The African Perioperative Research Group APORG was launched in South Africa ASOS and ASOS2 The studies showed that death after surgery is a major public health problem in Africa Surgical patients in Africa are twice as likely to die in hospital following surgery when compared to the global average ACCCOS Global Health Research Group on Childrens NonCommunicable Diseases Collaborative Many scholars from around the world have participated in overlapping trials whether as Principal Investigators Dissemination Committee or Regional leaders to promote the research and oversee data collection Notable collaborators from these networks include The list included key figures from around the World as Prof Bruce Biccard South Africa Prof Adesoji Ademuyiwa Nigeria Prof Kokila Lakhoo Oxford UK Dr Naomi Wright Oxford UK Dr Emrah Aydin Turkey Prof Mahmoud Elfiky Egypt and Prof Milind Chitnis South Africa  Multimorbidity agerelated diseases and aging  Multimorbidity is a growing public health problem worldwide likely driven by the ageing population but also by factors such as high bodymass index urbanisation and the growing burden of NCDs such as type 2 diabetes and tuberculosis in low and middleincome countries LMICs Around the world many people do not die from one isolated condition but from a multitude of factors and conditions A study suggested there is a paucity of multimorbidity and comorbidity data globally and mapped comorbidity patterns With aging populations there is a rise of agerelated diseases which puts major burdens on healthcare systems as well as contemporary economies or contemporary economics and their appendant societal systems Healthspan extension and antiaging research seek to extend the span of health in the old as well as slow aging or its negative impacts such as physical and mental decline Modern antisenescent and regenerative technology with augmented decision making could help responsibly bridge the healthspanlifespan gap for a future of equitable global wellbeing Aging is the most prevalent risk factor for chronic disease frailty and disability and it is estimated that there will be over 2 billion persons age  60 by the year 2050 making it a large global health challenge that demands substantial and wellorchestrated or efficient efforts including interventions that alter and target the inborn aging process  Infertility crisis  A scientific review found that human sperm counts fell by 62 in the last 50 years are decreasing at an accelerating rate and are decreasing worldwide likely a result of factors such as poor diets endocrine disruptors in prevalent products unhealthy lifestyles and toxic forever chemicals in air and water  Health interventions  Global interventions for improved child health and survival include the promotion of breastfeeding zinc supplementation vitamin A fortification salt iodization hygiene interventions such as handwashing vaccinations and treatments of severe acute malnutrition The Global Health Council suggests a list of 32 treatments and health interventions that could potentially save several million lives each year Many populations face an outcome gap which refers to the gap between members of a population who have access to medical treatment versus those who do not Countries facing outcome gaps lack sustainable infrastructure In Guatemala a subset of the public sector the Programa de Accessibilidad a los Medicamentos Program for Access to Medicines had the lowest average availability 25 compared to the private sector 35 In the private sector the highest and lowestpriced medicines were 227 and 107 times more expensive than international reference prices respectively Treatments were generally unaffordable costing as much as 15 days wages for a course of the antibiotic ceftriaxone The public sector in Pakistan while having access to medicines at a lower price than international reference prices has a chronic shortage of and lack of access to basic medicines Journalist Laurie Garrett argues that the field of global health is not plagued by a lack of funds but that more funds do not always translate into positive outcomes The problem lies in the way these funds are allocated as they are often disproportionately allocated to alleviating a single disease Labor shortages In its 2006 World Health Report the WHO estimated a shortage of almost 43 million doctors midwives nurses and support workers worldwide especially in subSaharan Africa A 2022 study estimated that in 2019 the world had 1040 million 95 uncertainty interval 8351280 health workers including 128 million 97166 physicians 298 million 233377 nurses and midwives 46 million 3660 dentistry personnel and 52 million 4067 pharmaceutical personnel and found that subSaharan Africa south Asia and north Africa and the Middle East had the lowest densities of human resources for health However even when only considering current technologies and processes such as only little use of telehealth as of 2022 overall numbers of personnel and shortages do not consider subnational geographic distribution of various types of health workers or expertise  Global health security  The COVID19 pandemic has highlighted how global health security is reliant on all countries around the world including low and middleincome countries having strong health systems and at least a minimum of health research capacities In an article 2020 in Annals of Global Health the ESSENCE group outlined a mechanism for review of investment in health research capacity building in low and middleincome countries The review mechanism will give funders of research for health the information to identify the gaps in the capacity that exist in low and middleincome countries and the opportunity to work together to address those disparities The overall goal is increased coordinated support of research on national health priorities as well as improved pandemic preparedness in LMICs and eventually fewer countries with very limited health research capacity  Global factors impacting health   Climate change  A comprehensive annually scheduled study finds climate change is undermining every dimension of global health monitored and reports dire conclusions from tracking of impact indicators The effects of climate change have also increased the risk of health conditions such as lung disease or asthma which are caused by air pollution These medical conditions are caused due to extreme heatwaves or by higher concentrations of groundlevel ozone  Antimicrobial resistance  AMR has been described as a leading global health issue Globally 127 million deaths in 2019 were attributable to AMR That year AMR may have contributed to 5 million deaths and one in five people who died due to AMR were children under five years old  Organization  Governmental or intergovernmental organizations focused on global health include The United Nations World Health Organization International Agency for Research on Cancer IARC WHO Centre for Health Development WKC United Nations Childrens Fund UNICEF World Food Programme WFP Pan American Health Organization PAHO International Committee of the Red Cross Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC The Global Fund to Fight AIDS Tuberculosis and Malaria Presidents Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief PEPFAR Nongovernmental organizations focused on global health include Médecins Sans Frontières Doctors Without Borders MSF Bill  Melinda Gates Foundation  Governments and analysis  A study of select global health related organizations and initiatives suggests that major trends in global health governance appear to be towards more discretionary funding and away from core or longerterm funding towards defined multistakeholder governance and away from traditional governmentcentred representation and decisionmaking and towards narrower mandates or problemfocused vertical initiatives and away from broader systemic goals There is a growing willingness to use militaries in stateled support of global health efforts which have capabilities ranging from research surveillance and medical expertise to rapidly deployable largescale assets for logistics transportation and security  Global Health Security Agenda  The Global Health Security Agenda GHSA is a multilateral multisector effort that includes 60 participating countries and numerous private and public international organizations focused on building up worldwide health security capabilities toward meeting such threats as the spread of infectious disease On March 2628 2018 the GHSA held a highlevel meeting in Tbilisi Georgia on biosurveillance of infectious disease threats which include such modernday examples as HIVAIDS severe acute respiratory syndrome SARS H1N1 influenza multidrug resistant tuberculosisany emerging or reemerging disease that threatens human health and global economic stability This event brought together GHSA partner countries contributing countries of RealTime Surveillance Action Package and international partner organizations supporting the strengthening of capacities to detect infectious disease threats within the RealTime Surveillance Action Package and other crosscutting packages GHSA works through four main mechanisms of member action action packages task forces and international cooperation In 2015 the Steering Group of the GHSA agreed upon the implementation of their commitments through 11 Action Packages Action Packages are a commitment by member countries and their partners to work collaboratively towards development and implementation of International Health Regulations IHR Action packages are based on GHSAs aim to strengthen national and international capacity to prevent detect and respond to infectious disease threats Each action package consists of fiveyear targets measures of progress desired impacts country commitments and list of baseline assessments The Joint External Evaluation process derived as part of the IHR Monitoring and Evaluation Framework is an assessment of a countrys capacity for responding to public health threats So far G7 partners and EU have made a collective commitment to assist 76 countries whereas the US committed to helping 32 countries to achieve GHSA targets for IHR implementation In September 2014 a pilot tool was developed to measure progress of the Action Packages and applied in countries Georgia Peru Uganda Portugal the United Kingdom and Ukraine that volunteered to participate in an external assessment
