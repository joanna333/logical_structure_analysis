Anthropometry,Anthropometry   from Ancient Greek ἄνθρωπος ánthrōpos human and μέτρον métron measure refers to the measurement of the human individual An early tool of physical anthropology it has been used for identification for the purposes of understanding human physical variation in paleoanthropology and in various attempts to correlate physical with racial and psychological traits Anthropometry involves the systematic measurement of the physical properties of the human body primarily dimensional descriptors of body size and shape Since commonly used methods and approaches in analysing living standards were not helpful enough the anthropometric history became very useful for historians in answering questions that interested them Today anthropometry plays an important role in industrial design clothing design ergonomics and architecture where statistical data about the distribution of body dimensions in the population are used to optimize products Changes in lifestyles nutrition and ethnic composition of populations lead to changes in the distribution of body dimensions eg the rise in obesity and require regular updating of anthropometric data collections  History  The history of anthropometry includes and spans various concepts both scientific and pseudoscientific such as craniometry paleoanthropology biological anthropology phrenology physiognomy forensics criminology phylogeography human origins and craniofacial description as well as correlations between various anthropometrics and personal identity mental typology personality cranial vault and brain size and other factors At various times in history applications of anthropometry have ranged from accurate scientific description and epidemiological analysis to rationales for eugenics and overtly racist social movements One of its misuses was the discredited pseudoscience phrenology  Individual variation   Auxologic  Auxologic is a broad term covering the study of all aspects of human physical growth  Height  Human height varies greatly between individuals and across populations for a variety of complex biological genetic and environmental factors among others Due to methodological and practical problems its measurement is also subject to considerable error in statistical sampling The average height in genetically and environmentally homogeneous populations is often proportional across a large number of individuals Exceptional height variation around 20 deviation from a populations average within such a population is sometimes due to gigantism or dwarfism which are caused by specific genes or endocrine abnormalities It is important to note that a great degree of variation occurs between even the most common bodies 66 of the population and as such no person can be considered average In the most extreme population comparisons for example the average female height in Bolivia is 1422 cm 4 ft 80 in while the average male height in the Dinaric Alps is 1856 cm 6 ft 11 in an average difference of 434 cm 1 ft 51 in Similarly the shortest and tallest of individuals Chandra Bahadur Dangi and Robert Wadlow have ranged from 53272 cm 1 ft 9 in  8 ft 11 in respectively The age range where most females stop growing is 1518 years and the age range where most males stop growing is 1821 years  Weight  Human weight varies extensively both individually and across populations with the most extreme documented examples of adults being Lucia Zarate who weighed 21 kg 47 lb and Jon Brower Minnoch who weighed 640 kg 1400 lb and with population extremes ranging from 496 kg 1093 lb in Bangladesh to 874 kg 1927 lb in Micronesia  Organs  Adult brain size varies from 9749 cm3 5949 cu in to 14981 cm3 9142 cu in in females and 10529 cm3 6425 cu in to 14985 cm3 9144 cu in in males with the average being 1130 cm3 69 cu in and 1260 cm3 77 cu in respectively The right cerebral hemisphere is typically larger than the left whereas the cerebellar hemispheres are typically of more similar size Size of the human stomach varies significantly in adults with one study showing volumes ranging from 520 cm3 32 cu in to 1536 cm3 937 cu in and weights ranging from 77 grams 27 oz to 453 grams 160 oz Male and female genitalia exhibit considerable individual variation with penis size differing substantially and vaginal size differing significantly in healthy adults  Aesthetic  Human beauty and physical attractiveness have been preoccupations throughout history which often intersect with anthropometric standards Cosmetology facial symmetry and waisthip ratio are three such examples where measurements are commonly thought to be fundamental  Evolutionary science  Anthropometric studies today are conducted to investigate the evolutionary significance of differences in body proportion between populations whose ancestors lived in different environments Human populations exhibit climatic variation patterns similar to those of other largebodied mammals following Bergmanns rule which states that individuals in cold climates will tend to be larger than ones in warm climates and Allens rule which states that individuals in cold climates will tend to have shorter stubbier limbs than those in warm climates On a microevolutionary level anthropologists use anthropometric variation to reconstruct smallscale population history For instance John Relethfords studies of early 20thcentury anthropometric data from Ireland show that the geographical patterning of body proportions still exhibits traces of the invasions by the English and Norse centuries ago Similarly anthropometric indices namely comparison of the human stature was used to illustrate anthropometric trends This study was conducted by Jörg Baten and Sandew Hira and was based on the anthropological founds that human height is predetermined by the quality of the nutrition which used to be higher in the more developed countries The research was based on the datasets for Southern Chinese contract migrants who were sent to Suriname and Indonesia and included 13000 individuals  Measuring instruments   3D body scanners  Today anthropometry can be performed with threedimensional scanners A global collaborative study to examine the uses of threedimensional scanners for health care was launched in March 2007 The Body Benchmark Study will investigate the use of threedimensional scanners to calculate volumes and segmental volumes of an individual body scan The aim is to establish whether the Body Volume Index has the potential to be used as a longterm computerbased anthropometric measurement for health care In 2001 the UK conducted the largest sizing survey to date using scanners Since then several national surveys have followed in the UKs pioneering steps notably SizeUSA SizeMexico and SizeThailand the latter still ongoing SizeUK showed that the nation had become taller and heavier but not as much as expected Since 1951 when the last womens survey had taken place the average weight for women had gone up from 62 to 65 kg However recent research has shown that posture of the participant significantly influences the measurements taken the precision of 3D body scanner may or may not be high enough for industry tolerances and measurements taken may or may not be relevant to all applications eg garment construction Despite these current limitations 3D Body Scanning has been suggested as a replacement for body measurement prediction technologies which despite the great appeal have yet to be as reliable as real human data  Baropodographic  Baropodographic devices fall into two main categories i floorbased and ii inshoe The underlying technology is diverse ranging from piezoelectric sensor arrays to light refraction but the ultimate form of the data generated by all modern technologies is either a 2D image or a 2D image time series of the pressures acting under the plantar surface of the foot From these data other variables may be calculated see data analysis The spatial and temporal resolutions of the images generated by commercial pedobarographic systems range from approximately 3 to 10 mm and 25 to 500 Hz respectively Sensor technology limits finer resolution Such resolutions yield a contact area of approximately 500 sensors for a typical adult human foot with surface area of approximately 100 cm2 For a stance phase duration of approximately 06 seconds during normal walking approximately 150000 pressure values depending on the hardware specifications are recorded for each step  Neuroimaging  Direct measurements involve examinations of brains from corpses or more recently imaging techniques such as MRI which can be used on living persons Such measurements are used in research on neuroscience and intelligence Brain volume data and other craniometric data are used in mainstream science to compare modernday animal species and to analyze the evolution of the human species in archeology  Epidemiology and medical anthropology  Anthropometric measurements also have uses in epidemiology and medical anthropology for example in helping to determine the relationship between various body measurements height weight percentage body fat etc and medical outcomes Anthropometric measurements are frequently used to diagnose malnutrition in resourcepoor clinical settings  Forensics and criminology  Forensic anthropologists study the human skeleton in a legal setting A forensic anthropologist can assist in the identification of a decedent through various skeletal analyses that produce a biological profile Forensic anthropologists utilize the Fordisc program to help in the interpretation of craniofacial measurements in regards to ancestry determination One part of a biological profile is a persons ancestral affinity People with significant European or Middle Eastern ancestry generally have little to no prognathism a relatively long and narrow face a prominent brow ridge that protrudes forward from the forehead a narrow tearshaped nasal cavity a silled nasal aperture towershaped nasal bones a triangularshaped palate and an angular and sloping eye orbit shape People with considerable African ancestry typically have a broad and round nasal cavity no dam or nasal sill Quonset hutshaped nasal bones notable facial projection in the jaw and mouth area prognathism a rectangularshaped palate and a square or rectangular eye orbit shape A relatively small prognathism often characterizes people with considerable East Asian ancestry no nasal sill or dam an ovalshaped nasal cavity tentshaped nasal bones a horseshoeshaped palate and a rounded and nonsloping eye orbit shape Many of these characteristics are only a matter of frequency among those of particular ancestries their presence or absence of one or more does not automatically classify an individual into an ancestral group  Ergonomics  Ergonomics professionals apply an understanding of human factors to the design of equipment systems and working methods to improve comfort health safety and productivity This includes physical ergonomics in relation to human anatomy physiological and bio mechanical characteristics cognitive ergonomics in relation to perception memory reasoning motor response including humancomputer interaction mental workloads decision making skilled performance human reliability work stress training and user experiences organizational ergonomics in relation to metrics of communication crew resource management work design schedules teamwork participation community cooperative work new work programs virtual organizations and telework environmental ergonomics in relation to human metrics affected by climate temperature pressure vibration and light visual ergonomics and others  Biometrics  Biometrics refers to the identification of humans by their characteristics or traits Biometrics is used in computer science as a form of identification and access control It is also used to identify individuals in groups that are under surveillance Biometric identifiers are the distinctive measurable characteristics used to label and describe individuals Biometric identifiers are often categorized as physiological versus behavioral characteristics Subclasses include dermatoglyphics and soft biometrics  United States military research  The US Military has conducted over 40 anthropometric surveys of US Military personnel between 1945 and 1988 including the 1988 Army Anthropometric Survey ANSUR of men and women with its 240 measures Statistical data from these surveys encompasses over 75000 individuals  Civilian American and European Surface Anthropometry Resource Project  CAESAR began in 1997 as a partnership between government represented by the US Air Force and NATO and industry represented by SAE International to collect and organize the most extensive sampling of consumer body measurements for comparison The project collected and organized data on 2400 US  Canadian and 2000 European civilians and a database was developed This database records the anthropometric variability of men and women aged 1865 of various weights ethnic groups gender geographic regions and socioeconomic status The study was conducted from April 1998 to early 2000 and included three scans per person in a standing pose fullcoverage pose and relaxed seating pose Data collection methods were standardized and documented so that the database can be consistently expanded and updated Highresolution measurements of body surfaces were made using 3D Surface Anthropometry This technology can capture hundreds of thousands of points in three dimensions on the human body surface in a few seconds It has many advantages over the old measurement system using tape measures anthropometers and other similar instruments It provides detail about the surface shape as well as 3D locations of measurements relative to each other and enables easy transfer to ComputerAided Design CAD or Manufacturing CAM tools The resulting scan is independent of the measurer making it easier to standardize Automatic landmark recognition ALR technology was used to extract anatomical landmarks from the 3D body scans automatically Eighty landmarks were placed on each subject More than 100 univariate measures were provided over 60 from the scan and approximately 40 using traditional measurements Demographic data such as age ethnic group gender geographic region education level and present occupation family income and more were also captured  Fashion design  Scientists working for private companies and government agencies conduct anthropometric studies to determine a range of sizes for clothing and other items For just one instance measurements of the foot are used in the manufacture and sale of footwear measurement devices may be used either to determine a retail shoe size directly eg the Brannock Device or to determine the detailed dimensions of the foot for custom manufacture eg ALINEr
