Animal studies,Animal studies is a recently recognised field in which animals are studied in a variety of crossdisciplinary ways Scholars who engage in animal studies may be formally trained in a number of diverse fields including art history anthropology biology film studies geography history psychology literary studies museology philosophy communication and sociology They engage with questions about notions of animality animalization or becoming animal to understand humanmade representations of and cultural ideas about the animal and what it is to be human by employing various theoretical perspectives Using these perspectives those who engage in animal studies seek to understand both humananimal relations now and in the past as defined by our knowledge of them Because the field is still developing scholars and others have some freedom to define their own criteria about what issues may structure the field  History  Animal studies became popular in the 1970s as an interdisciplinary subject animal studies exists at the intersection of a number of different fields of study such as journals and books series etc Different fields began to turn to animals as an important topic at different times and for various reasons and these separate disciplinary histories shape how scholars approach animal studies Historically the field of environmental history has encouraged attention to animals  Ethics  Throughout Western history humankind has put itself above the nonhuman species In part animal studies developed out of the animal liberation movement and was grounded in ethical questions about coexistence with other species whether it is moral to eat animals to do scientific research on animals for human benefit and so on Take rats for example with a history of being used as an experimental subject feeder and pest However fewer than 10 of research studies on animals result in new medical findings for human patients This has led researchers to find new Nonanimal Approach Methodologies NAMs that provide more accurate human reactions Animal studies scholars who explore the field from an ethical perspective frequently cite Australian philosopher Peter Singers 1975 work Animal Liberation as a founding document in animal studies Singers work followed Jeremy Benthams by trying to expand utilitarian questions about pleasure and pain beyond humans to other sentient creatures Overall progress happens slowly but the marginal voices help introduce new concepts and ethics that can eventually transform societys relationship with other species Some still believe that the primary purpose of animal interaction is solely for food However animal domestication created a new intimate bond between human and nonhuman and changed the way that humans live their lives Theorists interested in the role of animals in literature culture and Continental philosophy also consider the late work of Jacques Derrida a driving force behind the rise of interest in animal studies in the humanities Derridas final lecture series The Animal That Therefore I Am examined how interactions with animal life affect human attempts to define humanity and the self through language Taking up Derridas deconstruction and extending it to other cultural territory Cary Wolfe published Animal Rites in 2003 and critiqued earlier animal rights philosophers such as Peter Singer and Thomas Regan Wolfes study points out an insidious humanism at play in their philosophies and others Recently also the Italian philosopher Giorgio Agamben published a book on the question of the animal The Open Man and Animal  Art  Animals also played an essential role in the art community One of the earliest forms of art was on the walls of caves from the early man where they usually drew what they hunted The country of Namibia has a large collection of ancient rock art from the Stone Age The skillfully engraved depiction of animal tracks provides important information about the animals of that time Then in the Middle Ages animals would appear for more religious reasons Later in the 15th century artists began coinciding with animals as a serious subject when discoveries in foreign lands were brought back to England During the Renaissance era the influential artist Leonardo da Vinci took interest in animal studies Leonardo da Vinci studied animal anatomy to create anatomically accurate drawings of various species Years later animal representation took the form of woodworking lithography and photographs In the late 1800s photographers became interested in capturing animal locomotion  Research topics and methodologies  Researchers in animal studies examine the questions and issues that arise when traditional modes of humanistic and scientific inquiry begin to take animals seriously as subjects of thought and activity Students of animal studies may examine how humanity is defined in relation to animals or how representations of animals create understandings and misunderstandings of other species In fact animals often elicit fear in humans A wellknown animal phobia is ophidiophobia the fear of snakes People with animal phobias tend to negatively generalize animals even species that are harmless In most movies predatory animals such as sharks and wolves are usually the antagonists but this only causes significant damage to their reputation and makes people fear what they think their true nature is In order to do so animal studies pays close attention to the ways that humans anthropomorphize animals and asks how humans might avoid bias in observing other creatures Anthropomorphized animals are frequently found in childrens books and films Researchers are analyzing the positive and negative effects of anthropomorphized animals on a childs view of the nonhuman species In addition Donna Haraways book Primate Visions examines how dioramas created for the American Museum of Natural History showed family groupings that conformed to the traditional human nuclear family which misrepresented the animals observed behavior in the wild Critical approaches in animal studies have also considered representations of nonhuman animals in popular culture including species diversity in animated films By highlighting these issues animal studies strives to reexamine traditional ethical political and epistemological categories in the context of a renewed attention to and respect for animal life The assumption that focusing on animals might clarify human knowledge is neatly expressed in Claude LÃ©viStrausss famous dictum that animals are good to think
