Medical entomology,The discipline of medical entomology or public health entomology and also veterinary entomology is focused upon insects and arthropods that impact human health Veterinary entomology is included in this category because many animal diseases can jump species and become a human health threat for example bovine encephalitis Medical entomology also includes scientific research on the behavior ecology and epidemiology of arthropod disease vectors and involves a tremendous outreach to the public including local and state officials and other stake holders in the interest of public safety Public health entomology has seen a huge surge in interest since 2005 due to the resurgence of the bed bug Cimex lectularius  Insects of medical importance  There are many insects and other arthropods that affect human health These arthropods include Diptera Hemiptera Phthiraptera and Siphonaptera They can parasitize bite sting cause allergic reactions andor vector disease to humans It can be impossible to know the full impact that insects and other arthropods have on human health Medical entomologists worldwide are working to combat the known effects in order to improve public health  Personal pests  Personal pests such as lice fleas bedbugs ticks scabies mites may vector pathogens They are hematophagous meaning they feed on the blood of their host Nearly all personal pests can be transmitted to an uninfected host with prolonged exposure to an infected host Lice fleas bedbugs and ticks are known as ectoparasites Ectoparasites live on the skin of their host They have adaptations that allow them to access the nutrients inside of the host such as methods to penetrate skin insert digestive enzymes and a gut microbiome that can digest the nutrients received from the host While these ectoparasites feed the transfer of fluids may transmit diseases such as typhus plague and Lyme disease It is also suspected that bedbugs may also be vectors of hepatitis B Scabies mites cannot be classified as ectoparasites The mite that causes scabies Sarcoptes scabiei also known as the itch mite burrows into the skin of its host making it an endoparasite The act of S scabiei living in the skin and the allergic response to the parasite is the condition known as scabies  Housefly  The housefly is a very common and cosmopolitan species which transmits diseases to man The organisms of both amoebic and bacillary dysenteries are picked up by flies from the faeces of infected people and transferred to clean food either on the flys hairs or by the fly vomiting during feeding Typhoid germs may be deposited on food with the flys faeces The house fly cause the spread of yaws germs by carrying them from a yaws ulcer to an ordinary sore Houseflies also transmit poliomyelitis by carrying the virus from infected faeces to food or drink Cholera and hepatitis are sometimes flyborne Other diseases carried by houseflies are Salmonella tuberculosis anthrax and some forms of ophthalmia They carry over 100 pathogens and transmit some parasitic worms The flies in poorer and lowerhygiene areas usually carry more pathogens Some strains have become immune to most common insecticides  Cockroach  Cockroaches carry diseasecausing organisms typically gastroenteritis as they forage Cockroach excrement and cast skins also contain a number of allergens causing responses such as watery eyes rashes congestion of nasal passages and asthma  Biting insects  There are many insects that bite including mosquitoes biting midges sandflies black flies Horseflies and stable flies Through feeding insects or other arthropod vectors can transmit diseases to humans Medical entomologists and other medical professionals have helped to develop vaccines that can prevent humans from contracting some of those diseases They have also developed ways to prevent the arthropods from biting humans According to a study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention published in May 2018 illnesses caused by insect bites have tripled from 2004 to 2016  Insectborne diseases   Major  Dengue fever  Vectors Aedes aegypti main vector Aedes albopictus minor vector 50 million people are infected by dengue annually 25000 die Threatens 25 billion people in more than 100 countries Malaria  Vectors Anopheles mosquitoes 500 million become severely ill with malaria every year and more than one million die Leishmaniasis  Vectors species in the genus Lutzomyia in the New World and Phlebotomus in the Old World Two million people infected Bubonic plague  Principal vector Xenopsylla cheopis At least 100 flea species can transmit plague Reemerging major threat several thousand human cases per year High pathogenicity and rapid spread Sleeping sickness  Vector Tsetse fly not all species Sleeping sickness threatens millions of people in 36 countries of subSaharan Africa WHO Typhus Vectors mites fleas and body lice 16 million cases a year resulting in 600000 deaths annually Wuchereria bancrofti  most common vectors the mosquito species Culex Anopheles Mansonia and Aedes affects over 120 million people Yellow fever  Principal vectors Aedes simpsoni A africanus and A aegypti in Africa species in genus Haemagogus in South America and species in genus Sabethes in France 200000 estimated cases of yellow fever with 30000 deaths per year  Minor  Ross River fever  Vector Mosquitoes main vectors Aedes vigilax Aedes camptorhynchus and Culex annulirostris Barmah Forest Virus  Vector Known vectors Culex annulirostris Ocleratus vigilax and O camptorhynchus and Culicoides marksi Kunjin encephalitis mosquitoes Murray Valley encephalitis virus MVEV  Major mosquito vector Culex annulirostris Japanese encephalitis  Several mosquito vectors the most important being Culex tritaeniorhynchus West Nile virus  Vectors vary according to geographical area in the United States Culex pipiens Eastern US Culex tarsalis Midwest and West and Culex quinquefasciatus Southeast are the main vectors Lyme disease  Vectors several species of the genus Ixodes Alkhurma virus KFDV  Vector tick Kyasanur forest disease  Vector Haemaphysalis spinigera Brugia timori filariasis  Primary vector Anopheles barbirostris Babesia  Vector Ixodes ticks Carrions disease  Vectors sandflies of the genus Lutzomyia Chagas disease  Vector assassin bugs of the subfamily Triatominae The major vectors are species in the genera Triatoma Rhodnius and Panstrongylus Chikungunya  Vectors Aedes mosquitoes Human ewingii ehrlichiosis  Vector Amblyomma americanum Human granulocytic ehrlichiosis  Vector Ixodes scapularis Rift Valley Fever RVF  Vectors mosquitoes in the genera Aedes and Culex Scrub typhus  Vector Chigger Loa loa filariasis  Vector Chrysops sp
