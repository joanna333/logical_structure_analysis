Right to health,The right to health is the economic social and cultural right to a universal minimum standard of health to which all individuals are entitled The concept of a right to health has been enumerated in international agreements which include the Universal Declaration of Human Rights International Covenant on Economic Social and Cultural Rights and the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities There is debate on the interpretation and application of the right to health due to considerations such as how health is defined what minimum entitlements are encompassed in a right to health and which institutions are responsible for ensuring a right to health The Human Rights Measurement Initiative measures the right to health for countries around the world based on their level of income  Definition   Constitution of the World Health Organization 1946  The preamble of the 1946 World Health Organization WHO Constitution defines health broadly as a state of complete physical mental and social wellbeing and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity The Constitution defines the right to health as the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of health and enumerates some principles of this right as healthy child development equitable dissemination of medical knowledge and its benefits and governmentprovided social measures to ensure adequate health Frank P Grad credits the WHO Constitution as claiming  the full area of contemporary international public health establishing the right to health as a fundamental inalienable human right that governments cannot abridge and are rather obligated to protect and uphold The WHO Constitution notably marks the first formal demarcation of a right to health in international law  Universal Declaration of Human Rights 1948  Article 25 of the United Nations 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights states that Everyone has the right to a standard of living adequate for the health and wellbeing of himself and of his family including food clothing housing and medical care and necessary social services The Universal Declaration makes additional accommodations for security in case of physical debilitation or disability and makes special mention of care given to those in motherhood or childhood The Universal Declaration of Human Rights is noted as the first international declaration of fundamental human rights both freedoms and entitlements alike United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights Navanethem Pillay writes that the Universal Declaration of Human Rights enshrines a vision that requires taking all human rightscivil political economic social or culturalas an indivisible and organic whole inseparable and interdependent Likewise Gruskin et al contend that the interrelated nature of the rights expressed in the Universal Declaration establishes a responsibility that extends beyond the provision of essential health services to tackling the determinants of health such as provision of adequate education housing food and favourable working conditions further stating that these provisions are human rights themselves and are necessary for health  International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination 1965  Health is briefly addressed in the United Nations International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination which was adopted in 1965 and entered into effect in 1969 The Convention calls upon States to Prohibit and to eliminate racial discrimination in all its forms and to guarantee the right of everyone without distinction as to race color or national or ethnic origin to equality before the law and references under this provision The right to public health medical care social security and social services  International Covenant on Economic Social and Cultural Rights 1966  The United Nations further defines the right to health in Article 12 of the 1966 International Covenant on Economic Social and Cultural Rights which states The States Parties to the present Covenant recognize the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health The steps to be taken by the States Parties to the present Covenant to achieve the full realization of this right shall include those necessary for The reduction of the stillbirthrate and of infant mortality and for the healthy development of the child The improvement of all aspects of environmental and industrial hygiene The prevention treatment and control of epidemic endemic occupational and other diseases The creation of conditions which would assure to all medical service and medical attention in the event of sickness  General Comment No 14 2000  In 2000 the United Nations Committee on Economic Social and Cultural Rights issued General Comment No 14 which addresses substantive issues arising in the implementation of the International Covenant on Economic Social and Cultural Rights with respect to Article 12 and the right to the highest attainable standard of health The General Comment provides more explicit operational language on the freedoms and entitlements included under a right to health The General Comment makes the direct clarification that the right to health is not to be understood as a right to be healthy Instead the right to health is articulated as a set of both freedoms and entitlements which accommodate the individuals biological and social conditions as well as the States available resources both of which may preclude a right to be healthy for reasons beyond the influence or control of the State Article 12 tasks the State with recognizing that each individual holds an inherent right to the best feasible standard of health and itemizes at least in part the freedoms from and entitlements to that accompany such a right however it does not charge the State with ensuring that all individuals in fact are fully healthy nor that all individuals have made full recognition of the rights and opportunities enumerated in the right to health  Relation to other rights  Like the Universal Declaration of Human Rights the General Comment clarifies the interrelated nature of human rights stating that the right to health is closely related to and dependent upon the realization of other human rights and thereby underscoring the importance of advancements in other entitlements such as the rights to food work housing life nondiscrimination human dignity and access to importance among others towards the recognition of the right to health Similarly the General Comment acknowledges that the right to health embraces a wide range of socioeconomic factors that promote conditions in which people can lead a healthy life and extends to the underlying determinants of health In this respect the General Comment holds that the specific steps towards realizing the right to health enumerated in Article 12 are nonexhaustive and strictly illustrative in nature The inextricable link between Health and Human Rights Jonathan Mann was a FrancoisXavier Bagnoud Professor of Health and Human Rights and Professor of Epidemiology and International Health at the Harvard T H Chan School of Public Health He was known for being a powerful pioneer and advocate for the promotion of health ethics and human rights championing the theory that Health and Human Rights were inextricably interlinked in a dynamic relationship According to Mann Health and Human Rights are complementary approaches for defining and advancing human wellbeing In 1994 Jonathan Mann and his colleagues started the Health and Human Rights to underline the importance of this inextricable link between Health and Human Rights In the first volume of the Health and Human Rights Jonathan Mann and his colleagues published a transformative article to explore the potential collaboration in Health and Human Rights In this article Mann et al describe a framework for connecting the two domains that are interlinked This framework is broken into three broad relationships The first relationship between Health and Human Rights is a political one Mann and colleagues state that health policies programs and practices have an impact on human rights especially when state power is considered in the realm of public health Next the article posits a reverse relationship that human rights violations have health impacts It also calls for health expertise to help understand how health and wellbeing can be impacted by human rights violations through measurement and assessment The third segment of the framework linking Health and Human Rights introduces the concept that the protection and promotion of human rights and health are linked fundamentally in a dynamic relationship While literature has largely supported the first two relationships this third hypothesis has not been explored as substantially The article supports this concept by stating that this link suggests there are dramatic practical consequences in the independent operations of but also in the interaction in activities of the practice of public health and the practice of human rights There is what is deemed an interdependence that cannot be negated Mann and his colleagues further posit that research education experience and advocacy are all required to understand this intersection in order to understand and advance human wellbeing globally Ultimately Mann and his colleagues mission is to convey that while individual health has been much of the focus for medical and other health provision services especially concerning physical illness and disability public healths focus has more so evolved around how people can be healthy According to this surprisingly simple definition public healths mission is to promote positive health and prevention of health problems  disease disability premature death That is the traditional sense of individual health as understood and processed by health care services is one essential condition for health but does is not the sole qualifier or an exchangeable term with health In other words health care services are not sufficient for health as public health practitioners understand it  there are external factors that have both nuanced as well as pronounced positive and negative impact on health and wellbeing of the global human population  Health equity  The General Comment also makes additional reference to the question of health equity a concept not addressed in the initial International Covenant The document notes The Covenant proscribes any discrimination in access to health care and underlying determinants of health as well as to means and entitlements for their procurement Moreover responsibility for ameliorating discrimination and its effects with regards to health is delegated to the State States have a special obligation to provide those who do not have sufficient means with the necessary health insurance and healthcare facilities and to prevent any discrimination on internationally prohibited grounds in the provision of health care and health services Additional emphasis is placed upon nondiscrimination on the basis of gender age disability or membership in indigenous communities  Responsibilities of states and international organizations  Subsequent sections of the General Comment detail the obligations of nations and international organizations towards a right to health The obligations of nations are placed into three categories obligations to respect obligations to protect and obligations to fulfill the right to health Examples of these in nonexhaustive fashion include preventing discrimination in access or delivery of care refraining from limitations to contraceptive access or family planning restricting denial of access to health information reducing environmental pollution restricting coercive andor harmful culturallybased medical practices ensuring equitable access to social determinants of health and providing proper guidelines for the accreditation of medical facilities personnel and equipment International obligations include allowing for the enjoyment of health in other countries preventing violations of health in other countries cooperating in the provision of humanitarian aid for disasters and emergencies and refraining from use of embargoes on medical goods or personnel as an act of political or economic influence  Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women  Article 12 of the 1979 United Nations Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women outlines womens protection from gender discrimination when receiving health services and womens entitlement to specific genderrelated healthcare provisions The full text of Article 12 states Article 12 States Parties shall take all appropriate measures to eliminate discrimination against women in the field of health care in order to ensure on a basis of equality of men and women access to health care services including those related to family planning Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph I of this article States Parties shall ensure to women appropriate services in connection with pregnancy confinement and the postnatal period granting free services where necessary as well as adequate nutrition during pregnancy and lactation  Convention on the Rights of the Child  Health is mentioned on several instances in the Convention on the Rights of the Child 1989 Article 3 calls upon parties to ensure that institutions and facilities for the care of children adhere to health standards Article 17 recognizes the childs right to access information that is pertinent to hisher physical and mental health and wellbeing Article 23 makes specific reference to the rights of disabled children in which it includes health services rehabilitation preventive care Article 24 outlines child health in detail and states Parties recognize the right of the child to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of health and to facilities for the treatment of illness and rehabilitation of health States shall strive to ensure that no child is deprived of his or her right of access to such health care services Towards implementation of this provision the Convention enumerates the following measures To diminish infant and child mortality To ensure the provision of necessary medical assistance and health care to all children with an emphasis on the development of primary health care To combat disease and malnutrition including within the framework of primary health care through inter alia the application of readily available technology and through the provision of adequate nutritious foods and clean drinkingwater taking into consideration the dangers and risks of environmental pollution To ensure appropriate prenatal and postnatal health care for mothers To ensure that all segments of society in particular parents and children are informed have access to education and are supported in the use of basic knowledge of child health and nutrition the advantages of breastfeeding hygiene and environmental sanitation and the prevention of accidents To develop preventive health care guidance for parents and family planning education and services The World Health Organization website comments The CRC is the normative and legal framework for WHOs work across the broad spectrum of child and adolescent health Goldhagen presents the CRC as a template for child advocacy and proposes its use as a framework for reducing disparities and improving outcomes in child health  Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities  Article 25 of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities 2006 specifies that persons with disabilities have the right to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of health without discrimination on the basis of disability The subclauses of Article 25 state that States shall give the disabled the same range quality and standard of health care as it provides to other persons as well as those services specifically required for prevention identification and management of disability Further provisions specify that health care for the disabled should be made available in local communities and that care should be geographically equitable with additional statements against the denial or unequal provision of health services including food and fluids and life insurance on the basis of disability Hendriks criticizes the failure of the convention to define specifically the term disability he contends further that the absence of a clear description  may prejudice the uniform interpretation or at least place in jeopardy the consistent protection the Convention seeks to guarantee He does however acknowledge that the lack of a clear definition for disability may benefit the disabled by limiting the States ability to limit extension of the conventions provisions to specific populations or those with certain conditions  Definitions in academic literature  While most human rights are theoretically framed as negative rights meaning that they are areas upon which society cannot interfere or restrict by political action Mervyn Susser contends that the right to health is a particularly unique and challenging right because it is often expressed as a positive right where society bears an obligation to provide certain resources and opportunities to the general population Susser further sets out four provisions that he sees as covered under a right to health equitable access to health and medical services a goodfaith social effort to promote equal health among different social groups means to measure and assess health equity and equal sociopolitical systems to give all parties a unique voice in health advocacy and promotion He is careful to note here that while this likely entails some minimum standard of access to health resources it does not guarantee or necessitate an equitable state of health for each person due to inherent biological differences in health status This distinction is an important one as some common critiques of a right to health are that it establishes a right to an unreachable standard and that it aspires to a state of health that is too subjectively variable from person to person or from one society to the next While Sussers discussion centers on healthcare as a positive right Paul Hunt refutes this view and makes the argument that the right to health also encompasses certain negative rights such as a protection from discrimination and the right to not receive medical treatment without the recipients voluntary consent However Hunt does concede that some positive rights such as the responsibility of society to pay special attention to the health needs of the underserved and vulnerable are included in the right to health Paul Farmer addresses the issue of unequal access to health care in his article The Major Infectious Diseases in the World  To Treat or Not to Treat He discusses the growing outcome gap between the populations receiving health interventions and the ones that are not Poor people are not receiving the same treatment if any at all as the more financially fortunate The high costs of medicine and treatment make it problematic for poor countries to receive equal care He states Excellence without equity looms as the chief humanrights dilemma of health care in the 21st century  Human right to health care  An alternative way to conceptualize one facet of the right to health is a human right to health care Notably this encompasses both patient and provider rights in the delivery of healthcare services the latter being similarly open to frequent abuse by the states Patient rights in health care delivery include the right to privacy information life and quality care as well as freedom from discrimination torture and cruel inhumane or degrading treatment Marginalized groups such as migrants and persons who have been displaced racial and ethnic minorities women sexual minorities and those living with HIV are particularly vulnerable to violations of human rights in healthcare settings For instance racial and ethnic minorities may be segregated into poorer quality wards disabled persons may be contained and forcibly medicated drug users may be denied addiction treatment women may be forced into vaginal examinations and may be denied lifesaving abortions suspected homosexual men may be forced into anal examinations and women of marginalized groups and transgender persons may be forcibly sterilized Provider rights include the right to quality standards of working conditions the right to associate freely and the right to refuse to perform a procedure based on their morals Healthcare providers often experience violations of their rights For instance particularly in countries with weak rule of law healthcare providers are often forced to perform procedures which negate their morals deny marginalized groups the best possible standards of care breach patient confidentiality and conceal crimes against humanity and torture Furthermore providers who do not oblige these pressures are often persecuted Currently especially in the United States much debate surrounds the issue of provider consciousness which retains the right of providers to abstain from performing procedures that do not align with their moral code such as abortions Legal reform as a mechanism to combat and prevent violations of patient and provider rights presents a promising approach However in transitional countries newly formed countries undergoing reform and other settings with weak rule of law may be limited Resources and tools for lawyers providers and patients interested in improving human rights in patient care have been formulated  Constitutional right to health care  As of 2008 at least 115 national constitutions now recognize the right to health Sometimes these rights are justiciable meaning that they can be pursued by action in court Indeed a trend in constitutional reform around the world has been both to entrench the right to health and make it justiciable The US is an outlier to these trends at least at the federal level Nonetheless there have been campaigns in the US seeking to support a constitutional recognition of the right to health Where constitutions do recognize a justiciable right to health the responses by courts has been mixed In 2022 Oregon became the first state to enact a constitutional right to health care through Oregon Ballot Measure 111  Criticism  Harvardtrained scholar Philip Barlow writes that healthcare should not be considered a human right because of the difficulty of defining what it entails and where the minimum standard of entitlements under the right ought to be established Additionally Barlow contends that rights establish duties upon others to protect or guarantee them and that it is unclear who holds the social responsibility for the right to health John Berkeley in agreement with Barlow critiques further that the right to health does not consider adequately the responsibility that an individual has to uphold his or her own health American writer and politician Richard Lamm vehemently argues against making healthcare a right He defines a right as one that is to be defended at all costs and a concept that is defined and interpreted by the judicial system Making healthcare a right would require governments to spend a large portion of its resources to provide its citizens with it He asserts that the healthcare system is based on the erroneous assumption of unlimited resources as limited resources inhibit governments from providing everyone with adequate healthcare especially in the long term Attempting to provide beneficial healthcare to all people utilizing limited resources could lead to economic collapse Lamm asserts that access to healthcare but a small part in producing a healthy society and to create a healthy society resources should also be spent on social resources Another criticism of the right to health is that it is not feasible Imre JP Loefler former editor of Nairobi Hospital Proceedings and frequent contributor to the British Medical Journal argues that the financial and logistical burdens of ensuring health care for all are unattainable and that resource constraints make it unrealistic to justify a right towards prolonging life indefinitely Instead Loefler suggests that the goal of improving population health is better served through socioeconomic policy than a formal right to health
