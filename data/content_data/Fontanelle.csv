Fontanelle,A fontanelle or fontanel colloquially soft spot is an anatomical feature of the infant human skull comprising soft membranous gaps sutures between the cranial bones that make up the calvaria of a fetus or an infant Fontanelles allow for stretching and deformation of the neurocranium both during birth and later as the brain expands faster than the surrounding bone can grow Premature complete ossification of the sutures is called craniosynostosis After infancy the anterior fontanelle is known as the bregma  Structure  An infants skull consists of five main bones two frontal bones two parietal bones and one occipital bone These are joined by fibrous sutures which allow movement that facilitates childbirth and brain growth Posterior fontanelle is triangleshaped It lies at the junction between the sagittal suture and lambdoid suture At birth the skull features a small posterior fontanelle with an open area covered by a tough membrane where the two parietal bones adjoin the occipital bone at the lambda The posterior fontanelles ossify within 68 weeks after birth This is called intramembranous ossification The mesenchymal connective tissue turns into bone tissue Anterior fontanelle is a diamondshaped membranefilled space located between the two frontal and two parietal bones of the developing fetal skull It persists until approximately 18 months after birth It is at the junction of the coronal suture and sagittal suture The fetal anterior fontanelle may be palpated until 18 months In cleidocranial dysostosis however it is often late in closing at 824 months or may never close Examination of an infant includes palpating the anterior fontanelle Two smaller fontanelles are located on each side of the head more anteriorly the sphenoidal or anterolateral fontanelle between the sphenoid parietal temporal and frontal bones and more posteriorly the mastoid or posterolateral fontanelle between the temporal occipital and parietal bones During birth fontanelles enable the bony plates of the skull to flex allowing the childs head to pass through the birth canal The ossification of the bones of the skull causes the anterior fontanelle to close over by 9 to 18 months The sphenoidal and posterior fontanelles close during the first few months of life The closures eventually form the sutures of the neurocranium Other than the anterior and posterior fontanelles the mastoid fontanelle and the sphenoidal fontanelle are also significant  Closure  In humans the sequence of fontanelle closure is as follows The posterior fontanelle generally closes 2 to 3 months after birth The sphenoidal fontanelle is the next to close around 6 months after birth The mastoid fontanelle closes next from 6 to 18 months after birth and The anterior fontanelle is generally the last to close between 12 and 18 months  Clinical significance  The fontanelle may pulsate and although the precise cause of this is not known it is normal and seems to echo the heartbeat perhaps via the arterial pulse within the brain vasculature or in the meninges This pulsating action is how the soft spot got its name  fontanelle is borrowed from the old French word fontenele which is a diminutive of fontaine meaning spring It is assumed that the term spring is used because of the analogy of the dent in a rock or earth where a spring arises Parents may worry that their infant may be more prone to injury at the fontanelles In fact although they may colloquially be called softspots the membrane covering the fontanelles is extremely tough and difficult to penetrate Fontanelles allow the infant brain to be imaged using ultrasonography Once they are closed most of the brain is inaccessible to ultrasound imaging because the bony skull presents an acoustic barrier  Disorders   Bulging  A very tense or bulging anterior fontanelle indicates raised intracranial pressure Increased cranial pressure in infants may cause the fontanelles to bulge or the head to begin to enlarge abnormally It can occur due to Craniosynostosis  premature fusion of the cranial sutures Encephalitis  swelling inflammation of the brain most often due to infections Hydrocephalus  a buildup of fluid inside the skull Meningitis  infection of the membranes covering the brain Shaken baby syndrome  Sunken  A sunken also called depressed fontanelle indicates dehydration or malnutrition  Enlarged  The fontanelles may be enlarged may be slow to close or may never close most commonly due to causes like Down syndrome Hydrocephalus Intrauterine growth restriction IUGR Premature birth Rarer causes include Achondroplasia Apert syndrome Cleidocranial dysostosis Congenital rubella Neonatal hypothyroidism Osteogenesis imperfecta Rickets  Third  Sometimes there is a third bigger fontanelle other than posterior and anterior ones in a newborn In one study the frequency of third fontanelles in an unselected population of newborn infants was 63 It is very common in Down syndrome and some congenital infections If present the physician should rule out serious conditions associated with the third fontanelle  Other animals   Primates  In apes the fontanelles fuse soon after birth In chimpanzees the anterior fontanelle is fully closed by 3 months of age  Dogs  One of the more serious problems that can affect canines is known as an open fontanelle which occurs when the skull bones at the top of the head fail to close The problem is often found in conjunction with hydrocephalus which is a condition in which too much fluid is found within and around the brain placing pressure on the brain and surrounding tissues Often the head will appear domeshaped and the open fontanelle is noticeable as a soft spot on the top of the dogs head The fluidfilled spaces within the brain known as ventricles also become swollen The increased pressure damages or prevents the development of brain tissue Not all open fontanelles are connected with hydrocephalus In many young dogs the skull bones are not fused at birth but instead will close slowly over a three to sixmonth period Occasionally these bones fail to close but the dog is still healthy In these cases however the dogs owners need to be very careful since any injury or bumps to the animals head could cause significant brain damage as well as conditions like epilepsy An open fontanelle known as a molera is a recognized feature of the Chihuahua breed The American Kennel Club breed standard states that the skull of the Chihuahua should be domed with or without the molera being present However the Fédération Cynologique Internationale FCI standard for the Chihuahua lists an open fontanelle as a disqualification
