Outline of the human nervous system,The following diagram is provided as an overview of and topical guide to the human nervous system Human nervous system  the part of the human body that coordinates a persons voluntary and involuntary actions and transmits signals between different parts of the body The human nervous system consists of two main parts the central nervous system CNS and the peripheral nervous system PNS The CNS contains the brain and spinal cord The PNS consists mainly of nerves which are long fibers that connect the CNS to every other part of the body The PNS includes motor neurons mediating voluntary movement the autonomic nervous system comprising the sympathetic nervous system and the parasympathetic nervous system and regulating involuntary functions and the enteric nervous system a semiindependent part of the nervous system whose function is to control the gastrointestinal system  Evolution of the human nervous system  Evolution of nervous systems Evolution of human intelligence Evolution of the human brain Paleoneurology  Some branches of science that study the human nervous system  Neuroscience Neurology Paleoneurology  Central nervous system  The central nervous system CNS is the largest part of the nervous system and includes the brain and spinal cord Spinal cord  Brain  Brain  center of the nervous system Outline of the human brain List of regions of the human brain Principal regions of the vertebrate brain  Peripheral nervous system  Peripheral nervous system PNS  nervous system structures that do not lie within the CNS  Sensory system  A sensory system is a part of the nervous system responsible for processing sensory information A sensory system consists of sensory receptors neural pathways and parts of the brain involved in sensory perception List of sensory systems Sensory neuron Perception Visual system Auditory system Somatosensory system Vestibular system Olfactory system Taste Pain  Components of the nervous system  Neuron Interneuron Ganglion PNS vs Nucleus neuroanatomy CNS except basal ganglia CNS Nerve PNS vs Tract neuroanatomy CNS White matter more myelinated vs Grey matter  Glial cells  Glial cells commonly called neuroglia or glia are supportive cells that maintain homeostasis form myelin and provide support and protection for the brains neurons Microglia Astrocyte Oligodendrocyte CNS vs Schwann cell PNS  Neuron  A neuron also known as a neurone or nerve cell is an excitable cell in the nervous system that processes and transmits information by electrochemical signaling Neurons are the core components of the brain spinal cord and peripheral nerves Soma Axon Myelin Dendrite Dendritic spine  Action potential  An action potential or nerve impulse is a transient alteration of the transmembrane voltage or membrane potential across the membrane in an excitable cell generated by the activity of voltagegated ion channels embedded in the membrane The best known action potentials are pulselike waves that travel along the axons of neurons Membrane potential Ion channel Voltagegated ion channels  Synapse  Synapses are specialized junctions through which neurons signal to each other and to nonneuronal cells such as those in muscles or glands Chemical synapse Gap junction Synaptic plasticity Longterm potentiation  Neurotransmitter  Neurotransmitter  endogenous chemical that relays amplifies and modulates signals between neurons and other cells to which they are synaptically connected List of neurotransmitters Neuromodulator Monoamine neurotransmitter Neuropeptide  Neurotransmitter receptor  Neurotransmitter receptor  membrane receptor that can be activated by a neurotransmitter Interactions between neurotransmitters and neurotransmitter receptors can evoke a wide range of differing responses from the cell receiving the signal including excitation inhibition and various types of modulation CategoryReceptors  Biological neural network  Biological neural network  population of physically interconnected neurons that act cooperatively to form a functional circuit Computer scientists and engineers also study artificial neural networks formed by simplified mathematical abstractions of the signaling properties of biological neurons Central pattern generator Reflex arc Neural oscillations  Neural development  Neural development  comprises the processes that generate shape and reshape the nervous system from the earliest stages of embryogenesis to the final years of life Neural plasticity Neurogenesis Neuroregeneration  Prenatal development
