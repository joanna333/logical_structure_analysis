Clinical physiology,Clinical physiology is an academic discipline within the medical sciences and a clinical medical specialty for physicians in the health care systems of Sweden Denmark and Finland Clinical physiology is characterized as a branch of physiology that uses a functional approach to understand the pathophysiology of a disease  Overview  As a specialty for medical doctors clinical physiology is a diagnostic specialty in which patients are subjected to specialized tests for the functions of the heart blood vessels lungs kidneys and gastrointestinal tract and other organs Testing methods include evaluation of electrical activity eg electrocardiogram of the heart blood pressure eg ankle brachial pressure index and air flow eg pulmonary function testing using spirometry In addition Clinical Physiologists measure movements velocities and metabolic processes through imaging techniques such as ultrasound echocardiography magnetic resonance imaging MRI xray computed tomography CT and nuclear medicine scanners eg single photon emission computed tomography SPECT and positron emission tomography PET with and without CT or MRI  History  The field of clinical physiology was originally founded by Professor Torgny Sjöstrand in Sweden and it continues to make its way around the world in other hospitals and academic environments Sjöstrand was the first to establish departments for clinical physiology separate than those of physiology during his work at the Karolinska Hospital in Stockholm Along with Sjöstrand another influential name in clinical physiology was PK Anokhin Anohkin heavily contributed to the branch of physiology where he worked diligently to use his theories of functional systems to solve medical mysteries amongst his patients In Sweden clinical physiology was originally a discipline on its own however between 2008 and 2015 clinical physiology was categorized as a subdiscipline to radiology For this reason those pursuing a career in clinical physiology had to first become registered and certified radiologists before becoming clinical physiologists Since 2015 clinical physiology is once again a separate discipline independent of radiology  Role  Human physiology is the study of bodily functions Clinical physiology examinations typically involve assessments of such functions as opposed to assessments of structures and anatomy The specialty encompasses the development of new physiological tests for medical diagnostics Using equipments to measure monitor and record patients proves very helpful for patients in many hospitals Moreover it is helpful to doctors making it possible for patients to be diagnosed correctly Some Clinical Physiology departments perform tests from related medical specialties including nuclear medicine clinical neurophysiology and radiology In the health care systems of countries that lack this specialty the tests performed in clinical physiology are often performed by the various organspecific specialties in internal medicine such as cardiology pulmonology nephrology and others In Australia the United Kingdom and many other commonwealth and European countries clinical physiology is not a medical specialty for physicians It is individually a nonmedical allied health profession  scientist physiologist or technologist  who may practice as a cardiac scientist vascular scientist respiratory scientist sleep scientist or in Ophthalmic and Vision Science as an Ophthalmic Science Practitioner UK These professionals also aid in the diagnosis of disease and manage patients with an emphasis on understanding physiological and pathophysiological pathways Disciplines within clinical physiology field include audiologists cardiac physiologists gastrointestinal physiologists neurophysiologists respiratory physiologists and sleep physiologists
