Social simulation,Social simulation is a research field that applies computational methods to study issues in the social sciences The issues explored include problems in computational law psychology organizational behavior sociology political science economics anthropology geography engineering archaeology and linguistics Takahashi Sallach  Rouchier 2007 Social simulation aims to cross the gap between the descriptive approach used in the social sciences and the formal approach used in the natural sciences by moving the focus on the processesmechanismsbehaviors that build the social reality In social simulation computers support human reasoning activities by executing these mechanisms This field explores the simulation of societies as complex nonlinear systems which are difficult to study with classical mathematical equationbased models Robert Axelrod regards social simulation as a third way of doing science differing from both the deductive and inductive approach generating data that can be analysed inductively but coming from a rigorously specified set of rules rather than from direct measurement of the real world Thus simulating a phenomenon is akin to generating itconstructing artificial societies These ambitious aims have encountered several criticisms The social simulation approach to the social sciences is promoted and coordinated by four regional associations the European Social Simulation Association ESSA for Europe the Asian Social Simulation Association ASSA for Asia the Computational Social Science Society of the Americas CSSS in North America and the PanAsian Association for Agentbased Approach in Social Systems Sciences PAAA in Pacific Asia  History and development  The history of the agentbased model can be traced back to the Von Neumann machine a theoretical machine capable of reproducing itself The device von Neumann proposed would follow precisely detailed instructions to fashion a copy of itself The concept was then improved by von Neumanns friend Stanislaw Ulam also a mathematician Ulam suggested that the machine be built on paper as a collection of cells on a grid The idea intrigued von Neumann who drew it upcreating the first of devices later termed cellular automata Another improvement was brought by mathematician John Conway He constructed the wellknown Game of Life Unlike the von Neumanns machine Conways Game of Life operated by simple rules in a virtual world in the form of a 2dimensional checkerboard The birth of the agentbased model as a model for social systems was primarily brought about by a computer scientist Craig Reynolds He tried to model the reality of lively biological agents known as the artificial life a term coined by Christopher Langton Joshua M Epstein and Robert Axtell developed the first large scale agent model the Sugarscape to simulate and explore the role of social phenomena such as seasonal migrations pollution sexual reproduction combat transmission of disease and even culture Kathleen M Carley published Computational Organizational Science and Organizational Engineering defining the movement of simulation into organizations established a journal for social simulation applied to organizations and complex sociotechnical systems Computational and Mathematical Organization Theory and was the founding president of the North American Association of Computational Social and Organizational Systems that morphed into the current CSSSA Nigel Gilbert published with Klaus G Troitzsch the first textbook on social simulation Simulation for the Social Scientist 1999 and established its most relevant journal the Journal of Artificial Societies and Social Simulation More recently Ron Sun developed methods for basing agentbased simulation on models of human cognition known as cognitive social simulation see Sun 2006  Topics  Here are some sample topics that have been explored with social simulation Social norms Robert Axelrod has used simulations to investigate the foundation of morality others have modeled the emergence of norms using memes or how social norms and emotions can regulate each other Institutions by investigating under what conditions agents manage to coordinate or by modeling the works of Robert Putnam on civic traditions Reputation for example by making agents with a model of reputation from Pierre Bourdieu image social esteem and prestige and observing their behavior in a virtual marketplace Knowledge transmission and the social process of science there is a special section on that topic in the Journal of Artificial Societies and Social Simulation Elections Kim 2011 has modeled a psychological model of judgement from previous research notably featuring motivated reasoning and compared the statistical regularities of the simulation with empirical observations of voter behavior others have compared delegation methods Economics see computational economics and agentbased computational economics  Types of simulation and modeling  Social simulation can refer to a general class of strategies for understanding social dynamics using computers to simulate social systems Social simulation allows for a more systematic way of viewing the possibilities of outcomes There are four major types of social simulation System level simulation System level modeling Agentbased simulation Agentbased modeling A social simulation may fall within the rubric of computational sociology which is a recently developed branch of sociology that uses computation to analyze social phenomena The basic premise of computational sociology is to take advantage of computer simulations Polhill  Edmonds 2007 in the construction of social theories It involves the understanding of social agents the interaction among these agents and the effect of these interactions on the social aggregate Although the subject matter and methodologies in social science differ from those in natural science or computer science several of the approaches used in contemporary social simulation originated from fields such as physics and artificial intelligence  System level simulation  System Level Simulation SLS is the oldest level of social simulation System level simulation looks at the situation as a whole This theoretical outlook on social situations uses a wide range of information to determine what should happen to society and its members if certain variables are present Therefore with specific variables presented society and its members should have a certain response to the new situation Navigating through this theoretical simulation will allow researchers to develop educated ideas of what will happen under some specific variables For example if NASA were to conduct a system level simulation it would benefit the organization by providing a costeffective research method to navigate through the simulation This allows the researcher to steer through the virtual possibilities of the given simulation and develop safety procedures and to produce proven facts about how a certain situation will play out National Research 2006  System level modeling  System level modeling SLM aims to specifically predict unlike system level simulations generalization in prediction and convey any number of actions behaviors or other theoretical possibilities of nearly any person object construct et cetera within a system using a large set of mathematical equations and computer programming in the form of models A model is a representation of a specific thing ranging from objects and people to structures and products created through mathematical equations and are designed using computers in such a way that they are able to standin as the aforementioned things in a study Models can be either simplistic or complex depending on the need for either however models are intended to be simpler than what they are representing while remaining realistically similar in order to be used accurately They are built using a collection of data that is translated into computing languages that allow them to represent the system in question These models much like simulations are used to help us better understand specific roles and actions of different things so as to predict behavior and the like  Agentbased simulation  Agentbased social simulation ABSS consists of modeling different societies after artificial agents varying on scale and placing them in a computer simulated society to observe the behaviors of the agents From this data it is possible to learn about the reactions of the artificial agents and translate them into the results of nonartificial agents and simulations Three main fields in ABSS are agentbased computing social science and computer simulation Agentbased computing is the design of the model and agents while the computer simulation is the part of the simulation of the agents in the model and the outcomes The social science is a mixture of sciences and social part of the model It is where the social phenomena is developed and theorized The main purpose of ABSS is to provide models and tools for agentbased simulation of social phenomena With ABSS we can explore different outcomes for phenomena where we might not be able to view the outcome in real life It can provide us valuable information on society and the outcomes of social events or phenomena  Agentbased modeling  Agentbased modeling ABM is a system in which a collection of agents independently interact on networks Each individual agent is responsible for different behaviors that result in collective behaviors These behaviors as a whole help to define the workings of the network ABM focuses on human social interactions and how people work together and communicate with one another without having one single group mind This essentially means that it tends to focus on the consequences of interactions between people the agents in a population Researchers are better able to understand this type of modeling by modeling these dynamics on a smaller more localized level Essentially ABM helps to better understand interactions between people agents who in turn influence one another in response to these influences Simple individual rules or actions can result in coherent group behavior Changes in these individual acts can affect the collective group in any given population Agentbased modeling is an experimental tool for theoretical research It enables one to deal with more complex individual behaviors such as adaptation Overall through this type of modeling the creator or researcher aims to model behavior of agents and the communication between them in order to better understand how these individual interactions impact an entire population In essence ABM is a way of modeling and understanding different global patterns  Current research  There are several current research projects that relate directly to modeling and agentbased simulation the following are listed below with a brief overview Generative eSocial Science for SocioSpatial Simulation or GENESIS is a research node of the UK National Centre for eSocial Science funded by the UK research council ESRC National eInfrastructure for Social Simulation or NeISS is a UKbased project funded by JISC Network Models Governance and RD collaboration networks or NEMO is a research centre whose main focus is to identify ways to create and to assess desirable network structures for typical functions eg knowledge creation transfer and distribution This research will ultimately aid policymakers at all political levels in improving the effectiveness and efficiency of networkbased policy instruments at promoting the knowledge economy in Europe Agentbased Simulations of Market and Consumer Behavior is another research group that is funded by the Unilever Corporate Research The current research that is being conducted is investigating the usefulness of agentbased simulations for modeling consumer behavior and to show the potential value and insights it can add to longestablished marketing methods New and Emergent World Models Through Individual Evolutionary and Social Learning or New Ties is a threeyear project that will ultimately create a virtual society developed by agentbased simulation The project will develop a simulated society capable of exploring the environment and developing its own image of this environment and the society through interaction The goal of the research project is for the simulated society to exhibit individual learning evolutionary learning and social learning Bruch and Mares project on neighborhood segregation The purpose of the study is to figure out the reasoning for neighborhood segregation based on race and to figure out the tipping point or when people become uncomfortable with the integration levels into their neighborhood and decide to flee from the neighborhood They set up a model using flash cards and put the agents house in the middle and put houses of different races surrounding the agents house They asked people how comfortable they would feel with different situations if they were okay with one situation they asked another until the neighborhood was fully integrated Bruch and Mares results showed that the tipping point was at 50 When a neighborhood became 50 minority and 50 white people of both races began to become uncomfortable and white flight began to rise The use of agentbased modeling showed how useful it can be in the world of sociology people did not have to answer why they would become uncomfortable just which situation they were uncomfortable with The MAELIA Program MultiAgent Emergent Norms Assessment is a project dealing with the relationships between the users and managers of a natural resource in that case water and the related norms and laws that are to be built within them conventions or are imposed to them by other actors institutions The purpose of the project is to build a generic multiscale platform which is planned to deal with water conflictrelated issues The MosiAgil project is a fouryear program funded by the Autonomous Region of Madrid through the program MOSIAGILCM grant S2013ICE3019 cofunded by EU Structural Funds FSE and FEDER It aims at creating a body of knowledge and practical tools which are necessary to handle more effectively the behavior of occupants of large facilities Therefore the project studies the development of ambient intelligence and intelligent environments supported by the use of AgentBased Social Simulation Agentbased modeling is most useful in providing a bridge between micro and macro levels which is a large part of what sociology studies Agentbased models are most appropriate for studying processes that lack central coordination including the emergence of institutions that once established impose order from the top down The models focus on how simple and predictable local interactions generate familiar but highly detailed global patterns such as emergence of norms and participation of collective action Michael W Macy and Robert Willer researched a recent survey of applications and found that there were two main problems with agentbased modeling the selforganization of social structure and the emergence of social order Macy  Willer 2002 Below is a brief description of each problem Macy and Willer believe there to be Emergent structure In these models agents change location or behavior in response to social influences or selection pressures Agents may start out undifferentiated and then change location or behavior so as to avoid becoming different or isolated or in some cases overcrowded Rather than producing homogeneity however these conformist decisions aggregate to produce global patterns of cultural differentiation stratification and homophilic clustering in local networks Other studies reverse the process starting with a heterogeneous population and ending in convergence the coordination diffusion and sudden collapse of norms conventions innovations and technological standards Emergent social order These studies show how egoistic adaptation can lead to successful collective action without either altruism or global top down imposition of control A key finding across numerous studies is that the viability of trust cooperation and collective action depends decisively on the embeddedness of interaction These examples simply show the complexity of our environment and that agentbased models are designed to explore the minimal conditions the simplest set of assumptions about human behavior required for a given social phenomenon to emerge at a higher level of organization  Criticisms  Since its creation computerized social simulation has been the target of some criticism in regard to its practicality and accuracy Social simulations simplification of the complex to form models from which we can better understand the latter is sometimes seen as a draw back as using fairly simple models to simulate real life with computers is not always the best way to predict behavior Most of the criticism seems to be aimed at agentbased models and simulation and how they work Simulations being manmade from mathematical interfaces predict human behavior in a far too simple manner in regard to the complexities of humanity and our actions Simulations cannot enlighten researchers as to how people interact or behave in ways not programmed into their models For this reason the scope of simulations are limited in that the researchers must already know what they are going to find to a degree for they cannot find anything they themselves did not place in the model at least vaguely possibly skewing the results Due to the complexities of what is being measured simulations must be analyzed in unbiased ways however with the model running on a premade set of instructions coded into it by a modeler biases exist almost universally It is highly difficult and often impractical to attempt to link the findings from the abstract world the simulation creates and our complex society and all of its variation Researchers working in social simulation might respond that the competing theories from the social sciences are far simpler than those achieved through simulation and therefore suffer the aforementioned drawbacks much more strongly Theories in some social science tend to be linear models that are not dynamic and are generally inferred from small laboratory experiments laboratory tests are most common in psychology but rare in sociology political science economics and geography The behavior of populations of agents under these models is rarely tested or verified against empirical observation
