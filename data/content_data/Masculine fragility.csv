Masculine fragility,Masculine fragility is the anxiety among males who feel they do not meet cultural standards of masculinity Evidence suggests that this concept is necessary to understand their attitudes and behaviors Research has shown that this anxiety can manifest in various ways including aggressive behavior resistance to changing gender norms and difficulty in expressing vulnerability  Concept  Manhood is thought to be a precarious social status Unlike womanhood it is thought to be elusive and tenuous needing to be proven repeatedly It is neither inevitable nor permanent it must be earned against powerful odds As a result men who have their masculinity challenged may respond in ways that are unpleasant or even harmful  Factors   Race and ethnicity  Race is a factor in American standards of masculinity Hegemonic masculinity is denied to men of color as well as working class white men This has profound implications for the life trajectories and attitudes of AfricanAmerican men Asian American men are frequently unable to be perceived as masculine in American society and there is growing anger from young AsianAmerican men that they cannot be made to fit the standard of American masculinity It is a common complaint among young AsianAmerican men that they struggle to compete with White American men for Asian women This anger has led to the formation of online communities for Asian men who are concerned about their reputation and two such communities on Reddit have been implicated in the online harassment of Asian women who are in interracial relationships with White American men On the other hand some AsianAmerican men have rejected the hegemonic notion of masculinity and embraced their own alternative form of masculinity which values education and lawabidingness over American notions of masculinity  Age  As young men try to find their place in society age becomes an important variable in understanding male fragility Men in the 1825 age range display riskier and more aggressive behavior In some places younger men have constant threats to their manhood and have to prove their manhood daily The more the manhood was threatened the more the aggressiveness  Parenthood  Research has found that fathers are less likely to view masculinity as fragile compared to nonfathers This suggests that the experience of being a father might reinforce a mans masculine identity However low selfperceived masculinity after parenthood was a predictor of sexual depression among fathers  Behavior  When men feel their masculinity has been threatened they often attempt to regain their sense of authority The threats may include having a female supervisor or being given a job traditionally viewed as feminine They may react by engaging in harmful behavior such as undermining and mistreating colleagues lying for personal gain withholding help and stealing company property Online harassment is a common response from men who are intimidated by displays of strength by women A 2012 study using a racially diverse sample of jail inmates found that those who scored high on measurements of fragile masculinity tended to feel uncomfortable around women  Health  A 2014 study found that men who endorsed traditional values of masculinity had worse health outcomes Men with traditionally masculine beliefs are more likely to exhibit behaviors such as aggression when externally challenged and selfharm under stress when internally challenged Men with strongly held masculine beliefs are half as likely to seek preventative healthcare they are more likely to smoke drink heavily and avoid vegetables men are less likely to seek psychological help A review of recent research found a link between the endorsement of precarious masculinity and poorer health outcomes in men Although the link was modest it nevertheless accounted for some of mens poorer health outcomes relative to women  Sexual relationships  Women who believed their partner had fragile masculinity such as in relationships where women earn two times as much money as their partners were more likely to fake orgasms and were less likely to provide honest sexual communication However these authors cautioned against the assumption that either partner is to blame in such cases pointing out that American standards of masculinity are nearly impossible to meet  Political beliefs  A link has been shown between male fragility and aggressive political stances such as climate change denial This suggests that fragile masculinity is crucial to fully understanding mens political attitudes and behaviors The 2024 Trump campaign emphasized restoration of the traditional male role likely motivating a rightward shift in young men  Proposed solutions  Based on their research Maryam Kouchaki and colleagues have suggested that acknowledgement of fragile masculinity is a crucial first step toward improvement They point out that many men are not even aware that they feel threatened and that they are not even aware of toxic behaviors that may result from a threat Increased selfawareness may allow men to break this pattern Embracing healthy forms of masculinity was also suggested Finally these authors suggested that dismantling toxic workplace structures which encourage harmful masculine attitudes is a vital step in reducing fragile masculinity According to Stanaland and colleagues less rigid expectations of what masculinity should be could allow for a more resilient form of masculinity  Popular culture  The 2016 film Moonlight has been called a masterclass in masculine fragility Chiron according to writer Eli Badillo embraced his fragility as a path to selfdiscovery
