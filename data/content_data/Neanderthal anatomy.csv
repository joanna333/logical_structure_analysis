Neanderthal anatomy,Neanderthal anatomy differed from modern humans in that they had a more robust build and distinctive morphological features especially on the cranium which gradually accumulated more derived aspects particularly in certain isolated geographic regions This robust build was an effective adaptation for Neanderthals as they lived in the cold environments of Europe In which they also had to operate in Europes dense forest landscape that was extremely different from the environments of the African grassland plains that Homo sapiens adapted to with a different anatomical build Anatomical evidence suggests they were much stronger than modern humans possibly stronger than the chimpanzee given that theyre the humans closest living relative while they were 1214cm shorter on average than post World War II Europeans but as tall or slightly taller than Europeans of 20 KYA based on 45 long bones from at most 14 males and 7 females height estimates using different methods yielded averages in the range of 164168 cm 6566 in for males and 152 cm 60 in for females Samples of 26 specimens in 2010 found an average weight of 7883 kg 172183 lb for males and 6366 kg 139146 lb for females giving a considerably higher average BMI than H sapiens A 2007 genetic study suggested some Neanderthals may have had red hair This theory was later refuted the presence of genes related to red hair was due to contamination during the DNA extraction process in the study Neanderthal teeth also serve as a point of recognition in their anatomy This is because Neanderthal teeth illustrate nonprimitive accounts and different frequencies when in comparison to modern humans The research behind Neanderthal teeth morphology shows that it is a unique characteristic and evolutionary trait specifically only found within Neanderthals  Distinguishing physical traits  The magnitude of autapomorphic traits in specimens differ in time In the latest specimens autapomorphy is unclear The following is a list of physical traits that distinguish Neanderthals from modern humans However not all of them distinguish specific Neanderthal populations from various geographic areas evolutionary periods or other extinct humans Also many of these traits are present in modern humans to varying extent due to both archaic admixture and the retention of ancestral hominid traits shared with Neanderthals and other archaic humans Nothing is certain from unearthed bones about the shape of soft parts such as eyes ears and lips of Neanderthals While the structure of the head and face were not very far removed from those of modern humans there were still quite noticeable differences Notably the neanderthal head is much longer with a more pronounced facial front The Neanderthal chin and forehead sloped backwards and the nose region protruded forward more than in modern humans The common shapes of the nose are not known but it was more protrusive and large than modern humans especially in the passageways so Neanderthals could use energy much more efficiently than modern humans The brain space of the skull and so most likely the brain itself were larger than in modern humans When comparing traits to worldwide average present day human traits in Neanderthal specimens the following traits are distinguished The magnitude of particular trait changed over the 300000year timeline of Neanderthal evolution The large number of classic Neanderthal traits is significant because some examples of paleolithic and even modern Homo sapiens may sometimes show one or even a few of these traits but not most or all of them at the same time In October 2018 scientists announced the 3D virtual reconstruction for the first time of a Neanderthal rib cage which may help researchers better understand how this ancient human species moved and breathed In February 2019 scientists reported evidence that Neanderthals walked upright much like modern humans Cranial Sloping forehead Suprainiac fossa a groove above the inion Occipital bun a protuberance of the occipital bone which looks like a hair knot Projecting midface midsagittal prognathism Projecting jaws maxillary and mandibular prognathism Less neotenized skull than of a majority of modern humans Low elongated skull with flat lambdoid region Broad cranial vault with en bombe parietal morphology A flat basicranium Supraorbital ridge a prominent trabecular spongy brow ridge 15001740 cm3 92106 cu in cranial capacity modern human 1425 cm3 Lack of a protruding chin mental protuberance although later specimens possess a slight protuberance Crest on the mastoid process behind the ear opening No grooves between the roots of the canine teeth and the nasal opening A retromolar space posterior to the third molar Broad nose Bony projections on the sides of the nasal opening projecting nose Distinctive shape of the bony labyrinth in the ear Larger mental foramen in mandible for facial blood supply Subcranial Considerably more robust stronger build Long clavicles however Neanderthal clavicles are not relatively long if corrected for body weight and are proportionately similar to those of modern humans Broad shoulders and pelvis Large wide shoulder blades Broad chest Barrelshaped or bellshaped rib cage and no waist unclear and debated More laterally curved radius with a radial tuberosity placed more medially a longer radial neck a more ovoid radial head and a welldeveloped interosseous crest Curved limbs On the ulna the trochlear notch is facing more anteriorly the brachialis insertion is lower the midshaft is larger and the shaft is more sinusoidal Thick joints Large hands and feet Larger round finger tips Large kneecaps Thick bowed shaft of the thigh bones bowed femur Short tibiae Short fibulae Large calcaneus Long gracile pelvic pubis superior pubic ramus  Coldadapted theory  Some people thought that the large Neanderthal noses were an adaptation to the cold but primate and arctic animal studies have shown sinus size reduction in areas of extreme cold rather than enlargement in accordance with Allens rule Todd C Rae summarizes explanations about Neanderthal anatomy as trying to find explanations for the paradox that their traits are not coldadapted Therefore Rae concludes that the design of the large and extensive Neanderthal nose was evolved for the hotter climate of the Middle East and went unchanged when the Neanderthals entered Europe However Neanderthals in Spain date back to 700000 years prior to them living in the Middle East Rae supposes that Neanderthals due to increased physical activity and a large amount of muscle mass would have needed increased oxygen uptake Levantine Neanderthals had phenotypes significantly more similar to modern humans than European Neanderthals classic Neanderthals This may be because of gene flow from early modern humans in the Levantine corridor or the fact that the European Neanderthal phenotype is a specialized climatic adaptation  European Environment Effects  While Homo sapiens lived on the open African grassland plains Neanderthals lived in the densely forested landscapes of Europe Savanna grasslands compared to forested landscapes are extremely different environments Looking at Neanderthal anatomy it is already noted that Neanderthals have shorter legs particularly in the tibia and fibula leg bones below the knee compared to Homo sapiens These shortened legs of Neanderthals are seen as adaptions to the environments of Europe which are colder than those of the Levant and Africa The shorter legs also bring up evidence for other abilities that Neanderthals were better suited for in Europe due to the dense cold forests One of these abilities that Neanderthals have for the cold environments of Europe during 200000  40000 years ago is that they have long toes Along with longer toes Neanderthals are found to have longer heel bones when compared to Homo sapiens heel bones The Neanderthal anatomy is more suited for the cold environments of Europe as seen with their longer toes and longer heel bones because it made them wellsuited for hiking hunting and even sprinting in the hilly and forested environments that Europe had to offer  Teeth  Neanderthal teeth have a morphology that is a specifically derived trait in their species Neanderthals have a distinct dental morphology that is unique compared to the dental frequency patterns of Homo sapiens Also the Neanderthal mandibular has characteristics that are different from those of Homo sapiens Even when compared to Homo erectus a Neanderthals mandibular dental morphology is distinctive This finding indicates that Neanderthal teeth were not primitive forms like Homo erectus but that Neanderthal teeth traits are derived characteristics of their species Another study calculated crown creation time and molar eruption age and found that standard development variables like cuspal enamel thickness and longperiod line tendencies are also unique characteristic frequencies within Neanderthals compared to modern humans The study sampled 90 permanent teeth from 28 different Neanderthals and 39 permanent teeth from 9 different Homo sapiens fossils Results showed that Neanderthals have a thinner cuspal enamel that was formed in less time than in modern humans The thinner enamel in Neanderthals than in modern humans was a result of having a lower longperiod line periodicity and a faster extension rate which resulted in lower crown creation times than modern humans  Neanderthals lived in the cold environments of Europe so their diet mainly consisted of meat but recent studies found that some groups of Neanderthals were eating nuts edible fungus like mushrooms and moss with no indication of meat Looking strictly at toothbased resources for information of a Neanderthals diet and its effect on the teeth morphology is to look at hardened tooth plaque that contain microscopic remains Tooth plaque on Neanderthals teeth represent a meatheavy diet of wild animals  Pathology  West Asian and European Neanderthal skeletons show five broad groups of pathology or injury  Fractures  Neanderthals seemed to suffer a high frequency of fractures especially common on the ribs Shanidar IV La ChapelleauxSaints 1 Old Man the femur La Ferrassie 1 fibulae La Ferrassie 2 and Tabun 1 spine Kebara 2 and skull Shanidar I Krapina Sala 1 These fractures are often healed and show little or no sign of infection suggesting that injured individuals were cared for during times of incapacitation This frequency of such injuries is comparable to that of modern rodeo professionals and suggests frequent contact with large combative mammals The pattern of fractures along with the absence of throwing weapons suggests that Neanderthals may have hunted by leaping onto their prey and stabbing or even wrestling it to the ground  Trauma  Many Neanderthal skeletons show stab wounds as seen on Shanidar III whose lung was probably punctured by a stab wound to the chest between the eighth and ninth ribs This may have been an intentional attack or merely a hunting accident either way the man survived for some weeks after his injury before being killed by a rock fall in the Shanidar cave Other signs of trauma include blows to the head Shanidar I and IV Krapina all of which seemed to have healed although traces of the scalp wounds are visible on the surface of the skulls  Degenerative disease  Arthritis was common in the older Neanderthal population specifically targeting areas of articulation such as the ankle Shanidar III spine and hips La ChapelleauxSaints Old Man arms La Quina 5 Krapina Feldhofer knees fingers and toes This is closely related to degenerative joint disease which can range from normal userelated degeneration to painful debilitating restriction of movement and deformity and is seen in varying degree in the Shanidar skeletons IIV  Developmental stress  Two nonspecific indicators of stress during development are found in teeth which record stresses such as periods of food scarcity or illness that disrupt normal dental growth One indicator is enamel hypoplasia which appears as pits grooves or lines in the hard enamel covering of teeth The other indicator fluctuating asymmetry manifests as random departures from symmetry in paired biological structures such as right and left teeth Teeth do not grow in size after they form nor do they produce new enamel so enamel hypoplasia and fluctuating asymmetry provide a permanent record of developmental stresses occurring in infancy and childhood A study of 669 Neanderthal crowns showed that 75 of individuals suffered some degree of hypoplasia Two studies compared Neanderthals with the Tigara coastal whalehunting people from Point Hope Alaska finding comparable levels of linear enamel hypoplasia a specific form of hypoplasia and higher levels of fluctuating asymmetry in Neanderthals Estimated stress episode duration from Neanderthal linear enamel hyoplasias suggest that Neandertals experienced stresses lasting from two weeks to up to three months  Infection  Evidence of infections on Neanderthal skeletons is usually visible in the form of lesions on the bone which are created by systemic infection on areas closest to the bone Shanidar I has evidence of the degenerative lesions as does La Ferrassie 1 whose lesions on both femora tibiae and fibulae are indicative of a systemic infection or carcinoma malignant tumourcancer Further evidence of infections on Neanderthal anatomy are seen through ear infections due to the fact that their Eustachian tubes are flat In comparison to modern humans when infants grow up to become adults their Eustachian tubes become angled to allow for easy drainage of the ear and for bacteria to not grow in the ear Based on evidence from Pagano Márquez and Laitmans study Neanderthals ear canals never angled down when they aged as compared to modern human adults so their Eustachian tubes remained flat throughout their childhood and adulthood As a result of this Neanderthals were more prone to ear infections which can even cause hearing loss Today Neanderthal ear infections are typically seen in their anatomy by bone growths on their skulls that were caused by the ear infection commonly known as swimmers ear A study from Trinkaus Samsel and Villottes research article found that 48 of their 77 Neanderthal skull sample size showed that there were bone growths on the skulls to indicate the influence of swimmers ear infection  Childhood  Neanderthal children may have grown faster than modern human children Modern humans have the slowest body growth of any mammal during childhood the period between infancy and puberty with lack of growth during this period being made up later in an adolescent growth spurt The possibility that Neanderthal childhood growth was different was first raised in 1928 by the excavators of the Mousterian rockshelter of a Neanderthal juvenile Arthur Keith in 1931 wrote Apparently Neanderthal children assumed the appearances of maturity at an earlier age than modern children The rate of body maturation can be inferred by comparing the maturity of a juveniles fossil remains and the estimated age of death The age at which juveniles died can be indirectly inferred from their tooth morphology development and emergence This has been argued to both support and question the existence of a maturation difference between Neanderthals and modern humans Since 2007 tooth age can be directly calculated using the noninvasive imaging of growth patterns in tooth enamel by means of xray synchrotron microtomography This research supports the occurrence of much more rapid physical development in Neanderthals than in modern human children The xray synchrotron microtomography study of early H sapiens sapiens argues that this difference existed between the two species as far back as 160000 years before present More recent research published in September 2017 and based on a more complete skeleton of a Neanderthal juvenile 77 years old found in a 49000yearold site in Northern Spain indicates that Neanderthal children actually grew at a similar rate to modern humans Researchers were able to examine dental cranial and postcranial material allowing the assessment of dental and skeletal maturation with age In fact the main difference between Neandertals and modern humans was reported in the vertebral column Several features also indicated ongoing brain growth It was observed that the pattern of vertebral maturation and extended brain growth might reflect the broad Neanderthal body form and physiology rather than a fundamental difference in the overall pace of growth in Neanderthals compared to modern humans  Footnotes
