Anti-asthmatic agent,An antiasthmatic agent also known as an antiasthma drug refers to a drug that can aid in airway smooth muscle dilation to allow normal breathing during an asthma attack or reduce inflammation on the airway to decrease airway resistance for asthmatic patients or both The goal of asthmatic agents is to reduce asthma exacerbation frequencies and related hospital visits Antiasthmatic agents as rescue medications for acute asthma attacks include shortacting β2adrenergic receptor agonists SABA shortacting muscarinic antagonists SAMA systemic glucocorticoids and magnesium sulfate Antiasthmatic agents as maintenance medications for asthmatic symptom control include longacting β2adrenergic receptor agonists LABA inhaled glucocorticoids longacting muscarinic antagonists LAMA methylxanthinesphosphodiesterase inhibitors leukotriene receptor antagonists mast cell stabilizers and certain types of monoclonal antibodies Global Initiative of Asthma GINA is the official guideline on the usage of antiasthmatic agents The GINA guideline outlines the class dosage and administration of antiasthmatic agents prescription depending on the severity of asthma symptoms and nature  Rescue medications   Inhaled shortacting β2adrenergic agonists  Inhaled shortacting β2adrenergic agonists such as terbutaline and salbutamol are the firstline drugs indicated for asthma exacerbation for all patients to provide rapid bronchodilating effects Shortacting β2adrenergic agonists can be delivered by different devices for example nebulizers and metereddose inhalers β2adrenergic agonists can trigger the activation of Gs proteincoupled β2adrenergic receptors on the airway smooth muscle cells in the lungs The β2adrenergic receptors activation allows the adenylyl cyclase within the airway smooth muscle cells to catalyse the conversion of ATP to cAMP cAMP as a second messenger further activates protein kinase A and decreases the intracellular calcium level causing subsequent smooth muscle relaxation Common side effects of inhaled β2adrenergic agonists include tremors palpitations and headache The incidence and severity of side effects depend on the dose and route of administration of the β2adrenergic agonists  Inhaled shortacting muscarinic antagonists  Inhaled shortacting muscarinic antagonists such as oxitropium and ipratropium can be used as an adjunct therapy with shortacting β2adrenergic agonists in moderate to severe asthma exacerbations to achieve bronchodilation Shortacting muscarinic antagonists are usually discontinued upon hospital admission due to a lack of benefits among hospitalized patients Muscarinic antagonists can compete with acetylcholine for muscarinic receptors and provide an antagonistic effect on muscarinic receptors causing inhibition of cholinergic bronchomotor tone and hence bronchodilation Inhaled muscarinic antagonists commonly cause dry mouth throat irritation and dizziness  Systemic glucocorticoids  Systemic glucocorticoids such as oral prednisolone and intravenous hydrocortisone are indicated for moderate to severe asthma exacerbation to reduce airway inflammation It is important for patients with refractory asthma exacerbation who are already on intensive bronchodilator therapy as airflow resistance in the airway is likely to be caused by mucus accumulation and inflammation on the airway Systemic administration of glucocorticoids can reduce airway mucus production It can also suppress inflammatory responses by inhibiting the synthesis and release of inflammatory mediators and lowering the infiltration and activity of inflammatory cells Additionally glucocorticoids can increase the amount of β2adrenergic receptors and their sensitivity towards β2adrenergic agonists on the airway smooth muscles The use of systemic glucocorticoids may cause depressed immunity osteoporosis and Cushings syndrome The side effects of glucocorticoids depend on the dose and duration of treatment  Magnesium Sulfate  Magnesium sulfate is indicated for severe or lifethreatening asthma exacerbation to achieve bronchodilation Intravenous magnesium sulfate can reduce calcium ions influx into smooth muscle cells on the airway causing airway muscle relaxation It is possible for intravenous magnesium sulfate to cause hypermagnesemia resulting in muscle weakness Intravenous magnesium sulfate is contraindicated in patients with renal insufficiency  Maintenance medications   Longacting β2adrenergic agonists  Longacting β2adrenergic agonists for example vilanterol indacaterol olodaterol formoterol and salmeterol are commonly used together with inhaled corticosteroid in maintenance treatment  Inhaled glucocorticoids  Inhaled corticosteroids are commonly used together with longacting β2adrenergic agonists in maintenance therapy as corticosteroids can increase the amount of airway bronchial β2receptors and their sensitivity towards β2selective agents The use of inhaled corticosteroid may commonly cause dysphonia and overgrowth of oropharyngeal candidiasis The risk of overgrowth of oropharyngeal candidiasis can be reduced by rinsing the mouth with water after use  Longacting muscarinic antagonists  Longacting muscarinic antagonists including tiotropium aclidinium and umeclidinium are indicated for severe asthma in maintenance treatment Muscarinic antagonists can reduce cholinergic bronchomotor tone resulting in airway muscle relexation and bronchodilation Muscarinic antagonists commonly cause dry mouth throat irritation and dizziness  Methylxanthine  Phosphodiesterase Inhibitors  Methylxanthines including theophylline aminophylline and dyphylline are a class of drugs that can achieve bronchodilation and reduce bronchospasm for symptomatic control of asthma Methylxanthines act as a competitive inhibitor of phosphodiesterase inhibiting phosphodiesterase degradation action of cyclic 35adenosine monophosphate cAMP This resulted accumulation of cAMP relaxes smooth muscles leading to dilation of airways Methylxanthines activate histone deacetylases promoting the deacetylation of histone and subsequent DNA folding This inhibits the synthesis of proinflammatory factors that induce asthma attacks and exacerbations achieving antiinflammatory effects For asthma maintenance therapy methylxanthines are taken orally Therapeutic drug monitoring is required for patients on methylxanthines as the therapeutic range is narrow Methylxanthines are not routinely used owing to their adverse effect profiles and the risk of toxicity Adverse effects of Methylxanthines include nervousness insomnia irritability anxiety gastrointestinal disturbance nausea vomiting tremor palpitation and increased urine output  Leukotriene Receptor Antagonists  Leukotriene receptor antagonists including montelukast and zafirlukast inhibit proinflammatory leukotrienes bindings to LTC4 and LTD4 receptors This blocks the downstream inflammatory pathways that lead to bronchospasm and smooth muscle contractions in asthmatic patients Leukotriene receptor antagonists are taken orally Common adverse effects of leukotriene receptor antagonists include headache abdominal pain and diarrhoea  Mast cell stabilizers  Mast Cell Stabilizers including sodium cromoglycate nedocromil sodium amlexanox pemirolast potassium repirinast and tranilast are drugs that inhibit the degranulation and activation of mast cells upon contact with antigen This prevents the subsequent release of proinflammatory mediators such as histamines and leukotrienes Mast cell stabilizers are given as prophylactic treatment to prevent exacerbation of asthmatic symptoms For asthma maintenance therapy mast cell stabilizers are taken by inhalation Common adverse effects of Mast cell stabilizers include mouth dryness cough throat irritation nasal congestion and bronchospasm  Monoclonal Antibodies  Monoclonal Antibodies that aid in asthma symptomatic control include omalizumab mepolizumab reslizumab benralizumab dupilumab and tezepelumab Omalizumab binds to free human immunoglobulin IgE to reduce IgE level in circulation This reduces the subsequent binding of IgE to the IgE receptors on inflammatory cells including mast cells basophils and dendritic cells The release of inflammatory mediators is then prevented Mepolizumab and reslizumab inhibit Interleukin IL5 binding with IL5 receptors on the surface of eosinophils inhibiting subsequent inflammatory responses Benralizumab blocks the IL5 receptors on basophils preventing binding of IL5 with IL5 receptors on basophils inhibiting subsequent inflammatory responses Dupilumab blocks IL4 receptors inhibiting subsequent inflammatory activities of IL4 and IL13 Tezepelumab binds to thymic stromal lymphopoietin TSLP which is an inflammatory cytokine in the airway epithelial cells involved in asthma exacerbations inhibiting subsequent inflammatory responses Monoclonal antibodies for the treatment of asthmatic symptoms are given by subcutaneous injections Common adverse effects include local site reactions joint pain back pain headache and sore throat  Treatment steps   GINA guideline  According to the Global Initiative of Asthma GINA the guideline for antiasthmatic treatment is divided into 5 levels according to asthma severity For newly diagnosed asthma patients the 5 levels derived from the severity of asthma depend on the occurrence of symptoms and their frequencies These symptoms include bronchoconstriction shortness of breath and wheezing that exacerbates after physical activities Frequent coughing chest tightness and breathing difficulties are also signs of asthma worsening These symptoms can interfere with a patients daily living and affect quality of life These 5 levels are indicators of what drug treatments should be administered The guideline is as follows Step 12 Symptoms less than 45 days a week Lowdose inhaled corticosteroids and formoterol combination therapy when required Step 3 Symptoms most days or waking with asthma once a week or more Lowdose inhaled corticosteroids and formoterol maintenance therapy Step 4 Daily symptoms or waking with asthma once a week or more and low lung function Medium dose inhaled corticosteroids and formoterol maintenance therapy Shortcourse oral corticosteroids when required in severely uncontrolled asthma Step 5 Further worsening of symptoms and increased occurrence of exacerbations Addon longacting muscarinic antagonists Refer for phenotypic assessment with or without biologic therapy Consider high dose inhaled corticosteroids and formoterol maintenance therapy Consider AntiIgE antiiL55R antiIL4Rα or antiTSLP  Reliever Asneededonly low dose ICSformoterol  The rationale behind using inhaled corticosteroids and formoterol combination therapy as a reliever as opposed to salbutamol a shortacting β2adrenergic agonist is that this dosage regimen shows a reduction in the severe asthma exacerbation risk compared with using β2adrenergic agonists reliever As inhaled formoterol medications are often accompanied by a corticosteroid this combination is a simpler regimen for patients as it utilizes the same formulation for both reliever and maintenance therapy as well as providing a long duration of bronchodilation effect
