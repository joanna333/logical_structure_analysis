Force-field analysis,In social science forcefield analysis provides a framework for looking at the factors forces that influence a situation originally social situations It looks at forces that are either driving the movement toward a goal helping forces or blocking movement toward a goal hindering forces The principle developed by Kurt Lewin is a significant contribution to the fields of social science psychology social psychology community psychology communication organizational development process management and change management  History  Lewin a social psychologist believed the field to be a Gestalt psychological environment existing in an individuals or in the collective group mind at a certain point in time that can be mathematically described in a topological constellation of constructs The field is very dynamic changing with time and experience When fully constructed an individuals field Lewin used the term life space describes that persons motives values needs moods goals anxieties and ideals Lewin believed that changes of an individuals life space depend upon that individuals internalization of external stimuli from the physical and social world into the life space Although Lewin did not use the word experiential see experiential learning he nonetheless believed that interaction experience of the life space with external stimuli at what he calls the boundary zone was important for development or regression For Lewin the development or regression of an individual occurs when their life space has a boundary zone experience with external stimuli Note it is not merely the experience that causes a change in the life space but the acceptance internalization of external stimuli Lewin took these same principles and applied them to the analysis of group conflict learning adolescence hatred morale German society etc This approach allowed him to break down common misconceptions of these social phenomena and to determine their basic elemental constructs He used theory mathematics and common sense to define a force field and hence to determine the causes of human and group behaviour
