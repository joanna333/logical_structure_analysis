Darwin's tubercle,Darwins tubercle or auricular tubercle is a congenital ear condition which often presents as a thickening on the helix at the junction of the upper and middle thirds  History  This atavistic feature is so called because its description was first published by Charles Darwin in the opening pages of The Descent of Man and Selection in Relation to Sex as evidence of a vestigial feature indicating common ancestry among primates which have pointy ears However Darwin himself named it the Woolnerian tip after Thomas Woolner a British sculptor who had depicted it in one of his sculptures and had first theorised that it was an atavistic feature  Prevalence  The feature is present in approximately 104 of the Spanish adult population 40 of adults in India and 58 of Swedish school children This acuminate nodule represents the point of the mammalian ear The trait can potentially be bilateral meaning present on both ears or unilateral where it is present on only one ear There is mixed evidence in regard to whether the bilateral or unilateral expression is related to population or other factors Some populations express full bilateral while others may express either unilateral or bilateral However bilateral appears to be more common than unilateral as it pertains to the expression of the trait  Inheritance  The gene for Darwins tubercle was once thought to be inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern with incomplete penetrance meaning that those who possess the allele version of a gene will not necessarily present with the phenotype However genetic and family studies have demonstrated that the presence of Darwins tubercle may be more likely to be influenced by ones environment or developmental accidents than it is by genetics alone There is no clear argument for whether the trait has significance in sexual dimorphism studies or age related studies In some studies there is clear data that Darwins tubercle is not associated with sex In contrast others indicate that there is a correlation with sexual dimorphism between men and women where men tend to have the tubercle more than women in some populations Two studies indicate that older men tend to have greater expression of Darwins tubercle than do older women
