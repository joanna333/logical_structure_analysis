Diabetes self-management,Diabetes selfmanagement refers to the ongoing process in which individuals with diabetes actively participate in managing their condition through lifestyle choices medication adherence blood glucose monitoring and education aimed at maintaining optimal blood sugar levels and preventing complications Diabetes is a chronic disease affecting over 537 million adults worldwide in 2021 and predicted to reach 643 million people by 2030 It is a global health burden and improving the health outcomes for people with diabetes is critical to reducing the economic and human burden of diabetes Selfmanagement is the cornerstone for successful health outcomes in diabetes patients as there is a positive association between selfmanagement behaviour and care outcomes Selfmanagement stresses the importance of the role of an individual and their responsibility in developing skilled behaviours to manage ones own illness  Selfmanagement activities  Healthcare organisations are increasingly focusing on providing diabetes selfmanagement education and support programs to enable diabetes patients to effective selfmanagement Diabetes patients face daily challenges due to the impact of their decisions on their health outcomes Diabetes selfmanagement helps diabetes patients to make better decisions and change their behaviour to achieve better outcomes Diabetes selfmanagement activities mainly consist of seven selfcare behaviours They are healthy eating monitoring indicators of diabetes physical activity taking medication healthy coping and problemsolving  Foot care  Diabetes patients with peripheral neuropathy and peripheral artery disease are at risk of developing foot ulcers and infection Poor knowledge about selfcare increases the risk of amputation Adoption of suitable preventative measures and early treatment of diabetic foot problems are important components of diabetes foot care Good knowledge and practice regarding diabetes foot care can reduce the risk of foot complications and amputation Regular examination of the foot is one of the fundamental steps to modifying the foot risk factors thereby reducing the risk of ulceration and amputation Footwear tailored to the specific pathology of the patient can enable conservative management of the foot including debridement of the callus Appropriate footwear can reduce abnormal pressure reduce the rate of formation callus and ulcers and protect the foot from external trauma  Blood glucose monitoring  Regular monitoring of blood glucose and optimal glucose control is a major part of diabetes selfmanagement Diabetes patients need to be capable of testing blood sugar at home at the recommended frequency Frequent self monitoring of blood glucose and record keeping is key to identifying the possibility of hypoglycemia Diabetes patients should be able to know how to respond when blood sugar levels are too high or too low  Medication  Effective medication is the cornerstone of the proper treatment of diseases Many patients fail to take the medication as prescribed and many patients prematurely discontinue their medication Poor medication adherence in patients with diabetes is a costly public health challenge in many healthcare systems Nonadherence to medication leads to poor treatment outcomes and the progression of diseases and complications The medication adherence of type 1 and type 2 diabetes patients assessed using selfreport pill counts electronic monitoring devices and medication possession ratio found that the medication adherence rates ranged from 31 to 87 The medication adherence of diabetes patients is also measured by persistence which is defined by the proportion of patients who remained in treatment for a predetermined period and the mean number of days till discontinuation of treatment The persistence rates ranged from 16 to 63 at 12 months and ranged from 29 to 70  Physical activity  Physical activity has a favourable influence on the health and wellbeing of diabetes patients as it achieves physiological changes including improved overall glycemic control liver insulin sensitivity muscle glucose uptake and utilisation and overcomes the metabolic abnormalities related to type 2 diabetes Diabetes patients can undertake light to moderate physical activity The type of physical activity that can be performed by diabetes patients needs to be determined after consultations with health care providers The physical activities recommended for diabetes patients include brisk walking recreational games and leisure time activities The most benefit of physical activity happens in the early progression of the disease  Healthy eating habits  A healthy diet is one component of the management of diabetes Dietary selfcare behaviours include eating a lowsaturatedfat diet making choices based on the glycemic index of food and controlling the amount of carbohydrates in food Sticking to the eating plan and following the diet plan when eating from a restaurant or when feeling stressed is a major challenge for diabetes patients  Recommended practices and specific behaviors  Understanding the levels recommended practices and patterns specific behaviors of primary daily diabetes selfmanagement from a heterogeneous sample population is essential to devise suitable interventions to enhance the daily diabetes management of diabetes patients Many of the diabetes selfmanagement data involve only a small and highly selected sample which does not represent the minorities and disadvantaged communities The study conducted on a heterogeneous sample of population including minorities found that selfmanagement levels increase with age The same study found that retired individuals and homemakers have better selfmanagement than employed individuals  Barriers to effective selfmanagement  Diabetes patients need to actively selfmanage their diseases in everyday life for good diabetes outcomes However there are certain barriers to the effective daytoday management of the disease This section identified the main barriers to the effective selfmanagement of diabetes  Financial constraints  Financial constraints or poverty is a barrier to effective selfmanagement as it prevents access to food healthcare medication and information The most significant impact of lack of financial resources is on the food consumption pattern resulting in a vicious cycle of high carbohydrate consumption and hyperglycaemia Diabetes patients with limited financial resources often report that they find it difficult to purchase adequate food and it becomes impossible to buy different food for the family Financial difficulties cause diabetes care to become a problem of least importance as they have more pressing needs such as feeding the family and repaying loans When it comes to buying medicines for diabetes management people from poor financial backgrounds choose food over medicine To save costs people from poor economic backgrounds alter the prescribed dosage of medication and medication is often taken with diabetes complications or the development of comorbid illness  Norms and belief system  The attitude towards selfcare behaviour is influenced by the local belief systems and social norms Patients who attribute diabetes control to god are less likely to selfmanage and control their sugar intake A study found that subjective norms attributed to 49 of the variance in the intent to perform diabetesrelated selfmanagement An individuals and their familys beliefs about diabetes influence how they make sense of their disease and make efforts to manage their illness For example individuals who are not adhering to the dietary intake shared the view that their decision to not follow the required dietary pattern is because they believe that their family friends and peers would not approve of their diet Inadequate family support and cultural beliefs prevent diabetes patients from adhering to a diet with lowsaturated fatty acids In Subsaharan Africa diabetes patients face social stigma from family and community members from diabetes and diabetesrelated selfmanagement requirements which prevent diabetesrelated selfcare A study found that when there is diabetes that runs in the family it becomes a family affair and participants normalise and downplay the seriousness of the disease Genderbased family roles prevent adhering to the medication In a study woman responsible for house duties were found to have inadequate time to visit health facilities resulting in their ignoring their health care needs such as diabetes management  Low knowledge  Diabetes knowledge has a significant influence on the selfcare and glycemic control of a diabetes patient The lower knowledge about diabetes can affect diabetes management Studies have found that patients lack of knowledge and poor selfcare practice is increasing the severity of diabetes every year The level of education is a factor that has a positive correlation with selfcare knowledge  Stigma  Family support is highly beneficial for effective selfcare Diabetesrelated stigma leads to a lack of family support and poor diabetesrelated selfmanagement behaviours  Inadequate support  Diabetes patients expressed dissatisfaction with the attitude of healthcare professionals as they directly wrote prescription and directions without a proper conversation with the patients This prevents patients from asking lingering questions about their health conditions and management Inadequate coordination between the health care providers and diabetes patients is a major barrier to properly implementing the care guidelines Lack of collaboration and coordination leads to information conflict affecting the quality of selfmanagement The diabetes patients who were identified to develop healthy diabetes management habits had a supportive patientprovider relationship People from economically disadvantaged backgrounds can have limited access to care which is one reason for inadequate coordination between healthcare providers and patients  Role of healthcare professionals  Healthcare professionals play a crucial role in diabetes selfmanagement Diabetes patients rely on health care professionals to obtain information and support in developing an individualised selfmanagement plan Selfmanagement goals and recommendations given by health care professionals were identified to have a significant positive impact on the eating habits and physical activity of diabetes patients Lack of proper emphasis on selfmanagement may suggest to diabetes patients that selfmanagement is either less important or even unimportant for diabetes management
