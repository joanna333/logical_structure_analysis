RNU4-2 syndrome,RNU42 Syndrome or ReNU syndrome is a neurodevelopmental disorder caused by de novo variants in the human gene RNU42 which encodes an RNA component of the major spliceosome It is characterized by hypotonia global developmental delay severely impaired intellectual development with poor or absent speech delayed walking or inability to walk feeding difficulties with poor overall growth dysmorphic facial features and brain anomalies including ventriculomegaly RNU42  ReNU syndrome is one of the most prevalent monogenic neurodevelopmental disorders with variants in RNU42 estimated to account for around 04 of all neurodevelopmental disorders The syndrome is an autosomal dominant genetic disorder caused by de novo variants in RNU42 a gene on chromosome 12 which encodes the small nuclear RNA snRNA U4 U4 is a component of the major spliceosome a complex of proteins and noncoding RNAs that is necessary for RNA splicing Most cases of RNU42  ReNU syndrome are explained by a 1bp insertion n64_65insT NR_0031372 which is thought to disrupt the interactions of snRNA U4 with the snRNA U6 affecting the stability of the ACAGAGA loop of U6 sRNA which binds 5 splice sites and induces splicing after U4U6 unwinding Disrupted splicing in particular a change in 5 splice site usage has been reported in individuals with variants in RNU42 The genetic etiology of RNU42  ReNU syndrome was first described in a preprint in April 2024 It was subsequently published by two research teams independently both who used data collected by Genomics England One team led by the English statistician Daniel Greene working at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai used a Bayesian analysis The other team involved a global collaboration led by Yuyang Chen and Nicola Whiffin of the University of Oxford Neurodevelopmental disorder with hypotonia brain anomalies distinctive facies and absent language NEDHAFA was a suggested name for this syndrome however ReNU syndrome pronounced renew was chosen through a collaboration between researchers and the families of those impacted by variants in RNU42 The name symbolises that this diagnosis renews hope for a brighter future for all those affected
