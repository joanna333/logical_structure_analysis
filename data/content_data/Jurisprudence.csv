Jurisprudence,Jurisprudence also known as theory of law or philosophy of law is the examination in a general perspective of what law is and what it ought to be It investigates issues such as the definition of law legal validity legal norms and values as well as the relationship between law and other fields of study including economics ethics history sociology and political philosophy Modern jurisprudence began in the 18th century and was based on the first principles of natural law civil law and the law of nations Contemporary philosophy of law addresses problems internal to law and legal systems and problems of law as a social institution that relates to the larger political and social context in which it exists Jurisprudence can be divided into categories both by the type of question scholars seek to answer and by the theories of jurisprudence or schools of thought regarding how those questions are best answered Natural law holds that there are rational objective limits to the power of rulers the foundations of law are accessible through reason and it is from these laws of nature that human laws gain force Analytic jurisprudence rejects natural laws fusing of what law is and what it ought to be espousing the use of a neutral point of view and descriptive language when referring to aspects of legal systems It encompasses theories such as legal positivism and legal realism Normative jurisprudence is concerned with evaluative theories of law dealing with what the goal or purpose of law is and what moral or political theories provide a foundation for the law It attempts to determine what the proper function of law should be what sorts of acts should be subject to legal sanctions and what sorts of punishment should be permitted Sociological jurisprudence studies the nature and functions of law in the light of social scientific knowledge It emphasises variation of legal phenomena between different cultures and societies It relies especially on empiricallyoriented social theory but draws theoretical resources from diverse disciplines Experimental jurisprudence seeks to investigate the content of legal concepts using the methods of social science unlike the philosophical methods of traditional jurisprudence The terms philosophy of law and jurisprudence are often used interchangeably though jurisprudence sometimes encompasses forms of reasoning that fit into economics or sociology  Overview  Whereas lawyers are interested in what the law is on a specific issue in a specific jurisdiction analytical philosophers of law are interested in identifying the features of law shared across cultures times and places Taken together these foundational features of law offer the kind of universal definition philosophers are after The general approach allows philosophers to ask questions about for example what separates law from morality politics or practical reason While the field has traditionally focused on giving an account of laws nature some scholars have begun to examine the nature of domains within law eg tort law contract law or criminal law These scholars focus on what makes certain domains of law distinctive and how one domain differs from another A particularly fecund area of research has been the distinction between tort law and criminal law which more generally bears on the difference between civil and criminal law In addition to analytic jurisprudence legal philosophy is also concerned with normative theories of law Normative jurisprudence involves normative evaluative and otherwise prescriptive questions about the law  Etymology and terminology  The English word is derived from the Latin iurisprudentia Iuris is the genitive form of ius meaning law and prudentia meaning prudence also discretion foresight forethought circumspection It refers to the exercise of good judgment common sense and caution especially in the conduct of practical matters The word first appeared in written English in 1628 at a time when the word prudence meant knowledge of or skill in a matter It may have entered English via the French jurisprudence which appeared earlier The terms philosophy of law and jurisprudence are often used interchangeably though jurisprudence sometimes encompasses forms of reasoning that fit into economics or sociology  History  Ancient jurisprudence begins with various Dharmaśāstra texts of India Dharmasutras of Āpastaṃba and Baudhāyana are examples In Ancient China the Daoists Confucians and Legalists all had competing theories of jurisprudence Jurisprudence in ancient Rome had its origins with the peritiexperts in the jus mos maiorum traditional law a body of oral laws and customs Praetors established a working body of laws by judging whether or not singular cases were capable of being prosecuted either by the edicta the annual pronunciation of prosecutable offences or in extraordinary situations additions made to the edicta A iudex originally a magistrate later a private individual appointed to judge a specific case would then prescribe a remedy according to the facts of the case The sentences of the iudex were supposed to be simple interpretations of the traditional customs butapart from considering what traditional customs applied in each casesoon developed a more equitable interpretation coherently adapting the law to newer social exigencies The law was then adjusted with evolving institutiones legal concepts while remaining in the traditional mode Praetors were replaced in the 3rd century BC by a laical body of prudentes Admission to this body was conditional upon proof of competence or experience Under the Roman Empire schools of law were created and practice of the law became more academic From the early Roman Empire to the 3rd century a relevant body of literature was produced by groups of scholars including the Proculians and Sabinians The scientific nature of the studies was unprecedented in ancient times After the 3rd century juris prudentia became a more bureaucratic activity with few notable authors It was during the Eastern Roman Empire 5th century that legal studies were once again undertaken in depth and it is from this cultural movement that Justinians Corpus Juris Civilis was born Modern jurisprudence began in the 18th century and was based on the first principles of natural law civil law and the law of nations  Natural law  Natural law holds that there are rational objective limits to the power of rulers the foundations of law are accessible through reason and it is from these laws of nature that human laws gain force The moral theory of natural law asserts that law is inherent in nature and constitutive of morality at least in part and that an objective moral order external to human legal systems underlies natural law On this view while legislators can enact and even successfully enforce immoral laws such laws are legally invalid The view is captured by the maxim an unjust law is no law at all where unjust means contrary to the natural law Natural law theory has medieval origins in the philosophy of Thomas Aquinas especially in his Treatise on law In late 20th century John Finnis revived interest in the theory and provided a modern reworking of it For one Finnis has argued that the maxim an unjust law is no law at all is a poor guide to the classical Thomist position In its general sense natural law theory may be compared to both stateofnature law and general law understood on the basis of being analogous to the laws of physical science Natural law is often contrasted to positive law which asserts law as the product of human activity and human volition Another approach to naturallaw jurisprudence generally asserts that human law must be in response to compelling reasons for action There are two readings of the naturallaw jurisprudential stance The strong natural law thesis holds that if a human law fails to be in response to compelling reasons then it is not properly a law at all This is captured imperfectly in the famous maxim lex iniusta non est lex an unjust law is no law at all The weak natural law thesis holds that if a human law fails to be in response to compelling reasons then it can still be called a law but it must be recognised as a defective law  Aristotle  Aristotle is often said to be the father of natural law Like his philosophical forefathers Socrates and Plato Aristotle posited the existence of natural justice or natural right dikaion physikon δικαίον φυσικόν Latin ius naturale His association with natural law is largely due to how he was interpreted by Thomas Aquinas This was based on Aquinas conflation of natural law and natural right the latter of which Aristotle posits in Book V of the Nicomachean Ethics Book IV of the Eudemian Ethics Aquinass influence was such as to affect a number of early translations of these passages though more recent translations render them more literally Aristotles theory of justice is bound up in his idea of the golden mean Indeed his treatment of what he calls political justice derives from his discussion of the just as a moral virtue derived as the mean between opposing vices just like every other virtue he describes His longest discussion of his theory of justice occurs in Nicomachean Ethics and begins by asking what sort of mean a just act is He argues that the term justice actually refers to two different but related ideas general justice and particular justice When a persons actions toward others are completely virtuous in all matters Aristotle calls them just in the sense of general justice as such this idea of justice is more or less coextensive with virtue Particular or partial justice by contrast is the part of general justice or the individual virtue that is concerned with treating others equitably Aristotle moves from this unqualified discussion of justice to a qualified view of political justice by which he means something close to the subject of modern jurisprudence Of political justice Aristotle argues that it is partly derived from nature and partly a matter of convention This can be taken as a statement that is similar to the views of modern natural law theorists But it must also be remembered that Aristotle is describing a view of morality not a system of law and therefore his remarks as to nature are about the grounding of the morality enacted as law not the laws themselves The best evidence of Aristotles having thought there was a natural law comes from the Rhetoric where Aristotle notes that aside from the particular laws that each people has set up for itself there is a common law that is according to nature The context of this remark however suggests only that Aristotle thought that it could be rhetorically advantageous to appeal to such a law especially when the particular law of ones own city was adverse to the case being made not that there actually was such a law Aristotle moreover considered certain candidates for a universally valid natural law to be wrong Aristotles theoretical paternity of the natural law tradition is consequently disputed  Thomas Aquinas  Thomas Aquinas is the foremost classical proponent of natural theology and the father of the Thomistic school of philosophy for a long time the primary philosophical approach of the Roman Catholic Church The work for which he is best known is the Summa Theologiae One of the thirtyfive Doctors of the Church he is considered by many Catholics to be the Churchs greatest theologian Consequently many institutions of learning have been named after him Aquinas distinguished four kinds of law eternal natural divine and human Eternal law refers to divine reason known only to God It is Gods plan for the universe Man needs this plan for without it he would totally lack direction Natural law is the participation in the eternal law by rational human creatures and is discovered by reason Divine law is revealed in the scriptures and is Gods positive law for mankind Human law is supported by reason and enacted for the common good Natural law is based on first principles  this is the first precept of the law that good is to be done and promoted and evil is to be avoided All other precepts of the natural law are based on this  The desires to live and to procreate are counted by Aquinas among those basic natural human values on which all other human values are based  School of Salamanca  Francisco de Vitoria was perhaps the first to develop a theory of ius gentium law of nations and thus is an important figure in the transition to modernity He extrapolated his ideas of legitimate sovereign power to international affairs concluding that such affairs ought to be determined by forms respecting of the rights of all and that the common good of the world should take precedence before the good of any single state This meant that relations between states ought to pass from being justified by force to being justified by law and justice Some scholars have upset the standard account of the origins of International law which emphasises the seminal text De iure belli ac pacis by Hugo Grotius and argued for Vitoria and later Suárezs importance as forerunners and potentially founders of the field Others such as Koskenniemi have argued that none of these humanist and scholastic thinkers can be understood to have founded international law in the modern sense instead placing its origins in the post1870 period Francisco Suárez regarded as among the greatest scholastics after Aquinas subdivided the concept of ius gentium Working with already wellformed categories he carefully distinguished ius inter gentes from ius intra gentes Ius inter gentes which corresponds to modern international law was something common to the majority of countries although being positive law not natural law it was not necessarily universal On the other hand ius intra gentes or civil law is specific to each nation  Lon Fuller  Writing after World War II Lon L Fuller defended a secular and procedural form of natural law He emphasised that the natural law must meet certain formal requirements such as being impartial and publicly knowable To the extent that an institutional system of social control falls short of these requirements Fuller argued we are less inclined to recognise it as a system of law or to give it our respect Thus the law must have a morality that goes beyond the societal rules under which laws are made  John Finnis  Sophisticated positivist and natural law theories sometimes resemble each other and may have certain points in common Identifying a particular theorist as a positivist or a natural law theorist sometimes involves matters of emphasis and degree and the particular influences on the theorists work The natural law theorists of the distant past such as Aquinas and John Locke made no distinction between analytic and normative jurisprudence while modern natural law theorists such as John Finnis who claim to be positivists still argue that law is moral by nature In his book Natural Law and Natural Rights 1980 2011 John Finnis provides a restatement of natural law doctrine  Analytic jurisprudence  Unlike experimental jurisprudence which investigates the content of legal concepts using the methods of social science analytical jurisprudence seeks to provide a general account of the nature of law through the tools of conceptual analysis The account is general in the sense of targeting universal features of law that hold at all times and places Analytic or clarificatory jurisprudence takes a neutral point of view and uses descriptive language when referring to various aspects of legal systems This was a philosophical development that rejected natural laws fusing of what law is and what it ought to be David Hume argued in A Treatise of Human Nature that people invariably slip from describing what the world is to asserting that we therefore ought to follow a particular course of action But as a matter of pure logic one cannot conclude that we ought to do something merely because something is the case So analysing and clarifying the way the world is must be treated as a strictly separate question from normative and evaluative questions of what ought to be done The most important questions of analytic jurisprudence are What are laws What is the law What is the relationship between law and powersociology and What is the relationship between law and morality Legal positivism is the dominant theory although there is a growing number of critics who offer their own interpretations  Historical school  Historical jurisprudence came to prominence during the debate on the proposed codification of German law In his book On the Vocation of Our Age for Legislation and Jurisprudence Friedrich Carl von Savigny argued that Germany did not have a legal language that would support codification because the traditions customs and beliefs of the German people did not include a belief in a code Historicists believe that law originates with society  Sociological jurisprudence  An effort systematically to inform jurisprudence from sociological insights developed from the beginning of the twentieth century as sociology began to establish itself as a distinct social science especially in the United States and in continental Europe In Germany Austria and France the work of the free law theorists eg Ernst Fuchs Hermann Kantorowicz Eugen Ehrlich and François Gény encouraged the use of sociological insights in the development of legal and juristic theory The most internationally influential advocacy for a sociological jurisprudence occurred in the United States where throughout the first half of the twentieth century Roscoe Pound for many years the Dean of Harvard Law School used this term to characterise his legal philosophy In the United States many later writers followed Pounds lead or developed distinctive approaches to sociological jurisprudence In Australia Julius Stone strongly defended and developed Pounds ideas In the 1930s a significant split between the sociological jurists and the American legal realists emerged In the second half of the twentieth century sociological jurisprudence as a distinct movement declined as jurisprudence came more strongly under the influence of analytical legal philosophy but with increasing criticism of dominant orientations of legal philosophy in Englishspeaking countries in the present century it has attracted renewed interest Increasingly its contemporary focus is on providing theoretical resources for jurists to aid their understanding of new types of regulation for example the diverse kinds of developing transnational law and the increasingly important interrelations of law and culture especially in multicultural Western societies As an approach to jurisprudence sociological jurisprudence uses the resources of social science to serve valueoriented juristic purposes As such it should be distinguished from sociology of law which as a field of social science has no necessary commitment to juristic aims  Legal positivism  Legal positivism is the view that the content of law is dependent on social facts and that a legal systems existence is not constrained by morality Within legal positivism theorists agree that laws content is a product of social facts but theorists disagree whether laws validity can be explained by incorporating moral values Legal positivists who argue against the incorporation of moral values to explain laws validity are labeled exclusive or hard legal positivists Joseph Razs legal positivism is an example of exclusive legal positivism Legal positivists who argue that laws validity can be explained by incorporating moral values are labeled inclusive or soft legal positivists The legal positivist theories of H L A Hart and Jules Coleman are examples of inclusive legal positivism Legal positivism has traditionally been associated with three doctrines the pedigree thesis the separability thesis and the discretion thesis The pedigree thesis says that the right way to determine whether a directive is law is to look at the directives source The thesis claims that it is the fact that the directive was issued by the proper official within a legitimate government for example that determines the directives legal validitynot the directives moral or practical merits The separability thesis states that law is conceptually distinct from morality While law might contain morality the separability thesis states that it is in no sense a necessary truth that laws reproduce or satisfy certain demands of morality though in fact they have often done so Legal positivists disagree about the extent of the separability thesis Exclusive legal positivists notably Joseph Raz go further than the standard thesis and deny that it is possible for morality to be a part of law at all The discretion thesis states that judges create new law when they are given discretion to adjudicate cases where existing law underdetermines the result  Thomas Hobbes  Hobbes was a social contractarian and believed that the law had peoples tacit consent He believed that society was formed from a state of nature to protect people from the state of war that would exist otherwise In Leviathan Hobbes argues that without an ordered society life would be solitary poor nasty brutish and short It is commonly said that Hobbess views on human nature were influenced by his times The English Civil War and the Cromwellian dictatorship had taken place and in reacting to that Hobbes felt that absolute authority vested in a monarch whose subjects obeyed the law was the basis of a civilized society  Bentham and Austin  John Austin and Jeremy Bentham were early legal positivists who sought to provide a descriptive account of law that describes the law as it is Austin explained the descriptive focus for legal positivism by saying The existence of law is one thing its merit and demerit another Whether it be or be not is one enquiry whether it be or be not conformable to an assumed standard is a different enquiry For Austin and Bentham a society is governed by a sovereign who has de facto authority Through the sovereigns authority come laws which for Austin and Bentham are commands backed by sanctions for noncompliance Along with Hume Bentham was an early and staunch supporter of the utilitarian concept and was an avid prison reformer advocate for democracy and firm atheist Benthams views about law and jurisprudence were popularized by his student John Austin Austin was the first chair of law at the new University of London from 1829 Austins utilitarian answer to what is law was that law is commands backed by threat of sanctions from a sovereign to whom people have a habit of obedience H L A Hart criticized Austin and Benthams early legal positivism because the command theory failed to account for individuals compliance with the law  Hans Kelsen  Hans Kelsen is considered one of the preeminent jurists of the 20th century and has been highly influential in Europe and Latin America although less so in common law countries His Pure Theory of Law describes law as binding norms while at the same time refusing to evaluate those norms That is legal science is to be separated from legal politics Central to the Pure Theory of Law is the notion of a basic norm Grundnorma hypothetical norm presupposed by the jurist from which all lower norms in the hierarchy of a legal system beginning with constitutional law are understood to derive their authority or the extent to which they are binding Kelsen contends that the extent to which legal norms are binding their specifically legal character can be understood without tracing it ultimately to some suprahuman source such as God personified Nature orof great importance in his timea personified State or Nation  H L A Hart  In the Englishspeaking world the most influential legal positivist of the twentieth century was H L A Hart professor of jurisprudence at Oxford University Hart argued that the law should be understood as a system of social rules In The Concept of Law Hart rejected Kelsens views that sanctions were essential to law and that a normative social phenomenon like law cannot be grounded in nonnormative social facts Hart claimed that law is the union of primary rules and secondary rules Primary rules require individuals to act or not act in certain ways and create duties for the governed to obey Secondary rules are rules that confer authority to create new primary rules or modify existing ones Secondary rules are divided into rules of adjudication how to resolve legal disputes rules of change how laws are amended and the rule of recognition how laws are identified as valid The validity of a legal system comes from the rule of recognition which is a customary practice of officials especially barristers and judges who identify certain acts and decisions as sources of law In 1981 Neil MacCormick wrote a pivotal book on Hart second edition published in 2008 which further refined and offered some important criticisms that led MacCormick to develop his own theory the best example of which is his Institutions of Law 2007 Other important critiques include those of Ronald Dworkin John Finnis and Joseph Raz In recent years debates on the nature of law have become increasingly finegrained One important debate is within legal positivism One school is sometimes called exclusive legal positivism and is associated with the view that the legal validity of a norm can never depend on its moral correctness A second school is labeled inclusive legal positivism a major proponent of which is Wil Waluchow and is associated with the view that moral considerations may but do not necessarily determine the legal validity of a norm  Joseph Raz  Joseph Razs theory of legal positivism argues against the incorporation of moral values to explain laws validity In Razs 1979 book The Authority of Law he criticised what he called the weak social thesis to explain law He formulates the weak social thesis as a Sometimes the identification of some laws turn on moral arguments but also with b In all legal systems the identification of some law turns on moral argument Raz argues that laws authority is identifiable purely through social sources without reference to moral reasoning This view he calls the sources thesis Raz suggests that any categorisation of rules beyond their role as authority is better left to sociology than to jurisprudence Some philosophers used to contend that positivism was the theory that held that there was no necessary connection between law and morality but influential contemporary positivistsincluding Joseph Raz John Gardner and Leslie Greenreject that view Raz claims it is a necessary truth that there are vices that a legal system cannot possibly have for example it cannot commit rape or murder  Legal realism  Legal realism is the view that a theory of law should be descriptive and account for the reasons why judges decide cases as they do Legal realism had some affinities with the sociology of law and sociological jurisprudence The essential tenet of legal realism is that all law is made by humans and thus should account for reasons besides legal rules that led to a legal decision There are two separate schools of legal realism American legal realism and Scandinavian legal realism American legal realism grew out of the writings of Oliver Wendell Holmes At the start of Holmess The Common Law he claims that the life of the law has not been logic it has been experience This view was a reaction to legal formalism that was popular the time due to the Christopher Columbus Langdell Holmess writings on jurisprudence also laid the foundations for the predictive theory of law In his article The Path of the Law Holmes argues that the object of legal studyis prediction the prediction of the incidence of the public force through the instrumentality of the courts For the American legal realists of the early twentieth century legal realism sought to describe the way judges decide cases For legal realists such as Jerome Frank judges start with the facts before them and then move to legal principles Before legal realism theories of jurisprudence turned this method around where judges were thought to begin with legal principles and then look to facts It has become common today to identify Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr as the main precursor of American Legal Realism other influences include Roscoe Pound Karl Llewellyn and Justice Benjamin Cardozo Karl Llewellyn another founder of the US legal realism movement similarly believed that the law is little more than putty in the hands of judges who are able to shape the outcome of cases based on their personal values or policy choices The Scandinavian school of legal realism argued that law can be explained through the empirical methods used by social scientists Prominent Scandinavian legal realists are Alf Ross Axel Hägerström and Karl Olivecrona Scandinavian legal realists also took a naturalist approach to law Despite its decline in popularity legal realism continues to influence a wide spectrum of jurisprudential schools today including critical legal studies feminist legal theory critical race theory sociology of law and law and economics  Critical legal studies  Critical legal studies are a new theory of jurisprudence that has developed since the 1970s The theory can generally be traced to American legal realism and is considered the first movement in legal theory and legal scholarship in the United States to have espoused a committed Left political stance and perspective It holds that the law is largely contradictory and can be best analyzed as an expression of the policy goals of a dominant social group  Constitutionalism   Legal interpretivism  American legal philosopher Ronald Dworkins legal theory attacks legal positivists that separate laws content from morality In his book Laws Empire Dworkin argued that law is an interpretive concept that requires barristers to find the bestfitting and most just solution to a legal dispute given their constitutional traditions According to him law is not entirely based on social facts but includes the best moral justification for the institutional facts and practices that form a societys legal tradition It follows from Dworkins view that one cannot know whether a society has a legal system in force or what any of its laws are until one knows some truths about the moral justifications of the social and political practices of that society It is consistent with Dworkins viewin contrast with the views of legal positivists or legal realiststhat noone in a society may know what its laws are because noone may know the best moral justification for its practices Interpretation according to Dworkins integrity theory of law has two dimensions To count as an interpretation the reading of a text must meet the criterion of fit Of those interpretations that fit however Dworkin maintains that the correct interpretation is the one that portrays the practices of the community in their best light or makes them the best that they can be But many writers have doubted whether there is a single best moral justification for the complex practices of any given community and others have doubted whether even if there is it should be counted as part of the law of that community  Therapeutic jurisprudence  Consequences of the operation of legal rules or legal proceduresor of the behavior of legal actors such as lawyers and judgesmay be either beneficial therapeutic or harmful antitherapeutic to people Therapeutic jurisprudence TJ studies law as a social force or agent and uses social science methods and data to study the extent to which a legal rule or practice affects the psychological wellbeing of the people it impacts  Normative jurisprudence  In addition to the question What is law legal philosophy is also concerned with normative or evaluative theories of law What is the goal or purpose of law What moral or political theories provide a foundation for the law What is the proper function of law What sorts of acts should be subject to punishment and what sorts of punishment should be permitted What is justice What rights do we have Is there a duty to obey the law What value has the rule of law Some of the different schools and leading thinkers are discussed below  Virtue jurisprudence  Aretaic moral theories such as contemporary virtue ethics emphasize the role of character in morality Virtue jurisprudence is the view that the laws should promote the development of virtuous character in citizens Historically this approach has been mainly associated with Aristotle or Thomas Aquinas Contemporary virtue jurisprudence is inspired by philosophical work on virtue ethics  Deontology  Deontology is the theory of duty or moral obligation The philosopher Immanuel Kant formulated one influential deontological theory of law He argued that any rule we follow must be able to be universally applied ie we must be willing for everyone to follow that rule A contemporary deontological approach can be found in the work of the legal philosopher Ronald Dworkin  Utilitarianism  Utilitarianism is the view that the laws should be crafted so as to produce the best consequences for the greatest number of people Historically utilitarian thinking about law has been associated with the philosopher Jeremy Bentham John Stuart Mill was a pupil of Benthams and was the torch bearer for utilitarian philosophy throughout the late nineteenth century In contemporary legal theory the utilitarian approach is frequently championed by scholars who work in the law and economics tradition  John Rawls  John Rawls was an American philosopher a professor of political philosophy at Harvard University and author of A Theory of Justice 1971 Political Liberalism Justice as Fairness A Restatement and The Law of Peoples He is widely considered one of the most important Englishlanguage political philosophers of the 20th century His theory of justice uses a method called original position to ask us which principles of justice we would choose to regulate the basic institutions of our society if we were behind a veil of ignorance Imagine we do not know who we areour race sex wealth status class or any distinguishing featureso that we would not be biased in our own favour Rawls argued from this original position that we would choose exactly the same political liberties for everyone like freedom of speech the right to vote and so on Also we would choose a system where there is only inequality because that produces incentives enough for the economic wellbeing of all society especially the poorest This is Rawlss famous difference principle Justice is fairness in the sense that the fairness of the original position of choice guarantees the fairness of the principles chosen in that position There are many other normative approaches to the philosophy of law including constitutionalism critical legal studies and libertarian theories of law  Experimental jurisprudence  Experimental jurisprudence seeks to investigate the content of legal concepts using the methods of social science unlike the philosophical methods of traditional jurisprudence  List of philosophers of law
