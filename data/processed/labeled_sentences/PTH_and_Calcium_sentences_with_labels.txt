"Parathyroid hormone (PTH) plays a crucial role in regulating calcium levels in the body. ' When calcium levels in the blood are too low, PTH is released from the parathyroid glands. -[Cause and Effect]-' This hormone then targets the bones, kidneys, and intestines to increase calcium levels. ' In the bones, PTH stimulates osteoclasts to break down bone matrix, releasing calcium into the bloodstream. ' In the kidneys, PTH increases calcium reabsorption and phosphate excretion, conserving calcium. ' Additionally, PTH stimulates the intestines to absorb more calcium from food intake. ' By these actions, PTH ensures that calcium levels remain within a narrow range necessary for various bodily functions, such as muscle contraction and nerve impulse transmission. ' If calcium levels are too high, PTH secretion is inhibited, thus preventing overaccumulation. -[Cause and Effect]-' This feedback mechanism maintains homeostasis of calcium in the body. ' Therefore, PTH is essential for calcium balance and overall health. ' Understanding how PTH regulates calcium is key to appreciating its importance in bone metabolism and overall bodily functions. ' Any disruption in PTH levels can lead to disorders like hypocalcemia or hypercalcemia, highlighting its critical role. -[Emphasis-'']",Explanation
