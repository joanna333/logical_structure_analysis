"After a fracture, the body initiates several physiological stages of bone healing.  Initially, the fracture site becomes swollen and bruised as blood vessels break, causing bleeding.  This bleeding is essential as it provides the raw material for new bone formation.  Next, the body lays down a soft callus, which is a mixture of collagen and minerals, to stabilize the fracture.  This callus acts as a scaffold for the growth of new bone cells.  Over the following weeks, the callus hardens and remodels into compact bone, restoring the bone's original strength.  During this phase, the body removes any excess bone material, fine-tuning the structure. -[Temporal Sequence] Eventually, the fracture site is completely healed, and the bone returns to its pre-fracture strength and appearance.  Bone healing is a complex process involving swelling, callus formation, hardening, and remodeling.  Understanding these stages is crucial for effective fracture treatment and recovery.",Causal
