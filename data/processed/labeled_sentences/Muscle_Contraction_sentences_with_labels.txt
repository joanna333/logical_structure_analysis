Sentence,Label
"Neural control of muscle contraction is a complex process that relies heavily on the coordination of action potentials, neurotransmitters, and motor units.",Definition
Action potentials in neurons are electrical signals that travel along the axon towards the neuromuscular junction.,Explanation
Motor units consist of a single motor neuron and all the muscle fibers it innervates.,Definition
"The size of a motor unit can vary; some are small, with only a few muscle fibers, while others are large, encompassing hundreds of muscle fibers.",Enumeration
The type of movement required often determines which motor units are activated.,Explanation
"For fine movements, smaller motor units are recruited, while larger motor units are used for more forceful contractions.",Comparison
"The dependency between action potentials, neurotransmitters, and motor units ensures precise and controlled muscle contractions under neural command.",Summary
Understanding this neural control is crucial for diagnosing and treating muscle disorders.,Purpose
