Sentence,Label
The Frank-Starling Law of the heart states that the force of heart contraction is directly proportional to the end-diastolic volume of the ventricles.,Definition
"This law explains that as the ventricles fill with more blood during diastole, the heart muscle stretches, which enhances its contractile ability.",Explanation
"Therefore, the Frank-Starling Law is crucial for maintaining an appropriate cardiac output under varying blood volume conditions.",Purpose
"Understanding this law helps explain how the heart adapts to changes in blood volume, ensuring that cardiac output remains relatively constant despite variations in filling.",Explanation
"In summary, the Frank-Starling Law is essential for the regulation of cardiac output through the mechanism of ventricular stretch and contraction.",Summary
