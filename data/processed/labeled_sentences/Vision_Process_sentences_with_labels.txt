"The eye is the organ responsible for vision, and it begins the process of sight.",Definition
"Photoreceptor cells, specifically rods and cones, are located in the retina and are crucial for detecting light.",Definition
"Rods are more sensitive to light but do not distinguish colors, while cones are responsible for color vision and work best in bright light.",Comparison
"When light enters the eye, it passes through the cornea, lens, and vitreous humor, eventually striking the retina.",Sequential
The rods and cones convert light into electrical signals.,Definition
These signals travel along the retinal ganglion cells through the optic nerve.,Sequential
"The optic nerve carries this information to the brain, where it is processed into the visual image we perceive.",Sequential
The brain's occipital lobe is primarily responsible for interpreting these signals into vision.,Explanation
"Without photoreceptor cells and the neural pathways, the eye would not be able to translate light into visual images.",Explanation
"Thus, photoreceptor function and neural pathways are essential for the physiological process of vision.",Emphasis
