Sentence,Label
Respiratory failure occurs when the lungs cannot adequately provide oxygen to the bloodstream or remove carbon dioxide from it.,Definition
There are two main types of respiratory failure: hypoxemic and hypercapnic.,Enumeration
"Hypoxemic respiratory failure happens when there is a low level of oxygen in the blood, even though carbon dioxide levels are normal.",Definition
"On the other hand, hypercapnic respiratory failure is characterized by elevated carbon dioxide levels in the blood, while oxygen levels remain within normal range.",Definition
"In contrast, hypercapnic failure often results from conditions that impair the ability of the lungs to exhale carbon dioxide effectively, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).",Contrast
"Mechanisms of respiratory failure include ventilation-perfusion mismatch, where the amount of blood flowing through the lungs does not match the amount of air reaching them.",Explanation
"Another mechanism is a decrease in the diffusion capacity of the lungs, which prevents adequate exchange of gases at the alveolar level.",Explanation
"Treatment may involve supplemental oxygen, mechanical ventilation, or addressing the underlying cause of the failure.",Solution
Understanding these types and mechanisms is crucial for effective diagnosis and management of respiratory failure.,Generalization
