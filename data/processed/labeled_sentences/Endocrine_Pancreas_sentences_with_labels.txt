"The endocrine pancreas cells play a crucial role in glucose homeostasis.  Alpha cells secrete glucagon, which increases blood glucose levels when they are low.  This is achieved by stimulating the liver to convert glycogen into glucose and release it into the bloodstream. -[Cause and Effect]- Beta cells, on the other hand, produce insulin, which lowers blood glucose levels when they are high.  Insulin facilitates the uptake of glucose by cells for energy or storage as glycogen.  Delta cells, though less well-known, contribute by secreting somatostatin, which inhibits the secretion of both glucagon and insulin, helping to maintain balance.  Together, these cells work in a coordinated manner to keep blood glucose levels within a narrow range, ensuring proper physiological function.",Explanation
