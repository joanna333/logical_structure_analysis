"As people age, muscles undergo several physiological changes that can significantly affect strength.  With aging, muscle mass often decreases, a process known as sarcopenia.  This loss of muscle mass is a major factor in reduced strength. -[Cause and Effect]- Additionally, the speed at which muscles generate force diminishes, slowing down reaction times. -[Cause and Effect]- The elasticity of muscle fibers decreases, making them less able to bounce back after contraction.  These changes are largely due to a decrease in the production of hormones like testosterone and growth hormone.  Furthermore, there is a reduction in the number and size of muscle fibers, particularly type II fibers which are crucial for powerful movements.  As a result, older adults may find it harder to perform tasks that require strength and power.  Despite these challenges, regular resistance training can help mitigate some of these effects, maintaining muscle mass and strength.  Understanding these physiological changes is crucial for developing effective exercise programs tailored to older adults.  By addressing these issues, it is possible to enhance the quality of life and independence in older age.  In summary, aging leads to significant muscle changes that impact strength, but these effects can be mitigated through targeted exercise.",Definition
