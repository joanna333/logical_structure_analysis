"The activation of NK cells is regulated by the balance of inhibitory and activating receptors on their surface, which recognize MHC molecules on the surface of cells.",Explanation
"If the inhibitory signals are stronger, NK cells remain inactive; however, if the activating signals outweigh the inhibitory ones, NK cells are activated to kill the target cell.",Explanation
NK cells are essential for the rapid initial response against viral infections before the adaptive immune system can be fully mobilized.,Explanation
"In contrast to adaptive immunity, which is highly specific, NK cells provide a broad defense mechanism against a wide range of pathogens.",Contrast
The presence of NK cells is vital for maintaining homeostasis and preventing the spread of infections and development of tumors.,Emphasis
"In summary, NK cells are critical for the immune system's ability to quickly eliminate compromised cells, providing a first line of defense against infections and cancer.",Summary
