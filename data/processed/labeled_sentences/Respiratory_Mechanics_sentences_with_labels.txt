Sentence,Label
Breathing involves the movement of air into and out of the lungs.,Definition
"The lungs have a certain degree of compliance, which means they can expand and contract easily.",Definition
Airway resistance plays a crucial role in breathing; it affects how easily air can flow through the respiratory tract.,Definition
"Airway resistance is higher in narrower passages, making breathing more difficult.",Explanation
Compliance and airway resistance work together to ensure efficient gas exchange.,Explanation
"Despite resistance, the lungs' compliance allows them to expand and fill with air.",Contrast
Understanding these mechanics helps in diagnosing breathing disorders.,Purpose
Breathing is a continuous process relying on the balance of lung compliance and airway resistance.,Summary
Breathing problems can occur if either compliance or resistance is compromised.,Generalization
"For instance, in asthma, airway resistance increases, making breathing harder.",Illustration
"On the other hand, emphysema reduces lung compliance, also impeding breathing.",Contrast
"Thus, both factors are essential for normal, effortless breathing.",Emphasis
Efforts to improve breathing often focus on reducing airway resistance and enhancing lung compliance.,Purpose
