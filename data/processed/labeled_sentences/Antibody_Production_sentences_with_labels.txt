Sentence,Label
B cells are a type of white blood cell crucial for the immune system's ability to produce antibodies.,Definition
"Antibodies are proteins that specifically recognize and bind to antigens, which are foreign substances in the body.",Definition
The process begins when an antigen enters the body and is recognized by cells of the immune system.,Sequential
"Dendritic cells, a type of antigen-presenting cell, capture the antigen and display fragments of it on their surface.",Sequential
"These fragments, known as antigens, are presented to T cells, which are another type of white blood cell.",Sequential
T cells must recognize the antigen presented by the dendritic cell to become activated.,Causal
"Once activated, the T cell helps to coordinate the immune response by releasing cytokines, which are signaling molecules.",Causal
The cytokines signal B cells to begin dividing and maturing into plasma cells.,Sequential
Plasma cells are specialized B cells that produce and secrete large quantities of antibodies.,Definition
"The antibodies then circulate in the bloodstream, ready to bind to the specific antigens they recognize.",Sequential
"This coordinated effort between B cells, T cells, and antigen presentation ensures a targeted and effective immune response.",Explanation
"In summary, the production of antibodies involves a series of steps where antigens are identified, presented to T cells, and then used to trigger the production of antibodies by B cells.",Summary
