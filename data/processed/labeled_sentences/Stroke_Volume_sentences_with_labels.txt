Sentence,Label
Stroke volume is the amount of blood ejected by the left ventricle of the heart with each beat.,Definition
"Several factors influence stroke volume, including preload, afterload, contractility, and heart rate.",Enumeration
"Heart rate, while not directly influencing stroke volume, can impact it indirectly through its effect on preload and contractility.",Conditional
The impact on cardiac output is significant because cardiac output is the product of stroke volume and heart rate.,Explanation
Understanding these factors is crucial for diagnosing and treating heart conditions that affect stroke volume and cardiac output.,Purpose
"In summary, stroke volume is influenced by preload, afterload, contractility, and heart rate, all of which have a direct or indirect impact on cardiac output.",Summary
