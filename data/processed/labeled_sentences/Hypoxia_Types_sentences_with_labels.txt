"There are several types of hypoxia, including acute hypoxia, chronic hypoxia, and hypoxic hypoxia.",Enumeration
"Chronic hypoxia develops over time and is often due to long-term exposure to low oxygen environments, such as living at high altitudes.",Definition
Physiological adaptations to low oxygen levels include increased red blood cell production and the release of erythropoietin.,Explanation
"The body also learns to use oxygen more efficiently, a process known as hypoxic ventilatory response.",Explanation
"In contrast, chronic hypoxia can lead to polycythemia, where the body produces too many red blood cells.",Contrast
"Hypoxic hypoxia specifically relates to a lack of oxygen in the inspired air, which can be caused by lung diseases or airway obstruction.",Definition
