"Neuroinflammation plays a significant role in central nervous system (CNS) disorders.  Neuroinflammation involves the immune response within the brain and spinal cord.  This response can be both protective and damaging depending on the context and duration.  In conditions like multiple sclerosis, neuroinflammation is causal, leading to the degradation of myelin sheaths.  Conversely, in Alzheimer's disease, neuroinflammation is associated, not causal, and serves as a contributing factor.  The inflammatory response can impair neuronal function and lead to cognitive decline.  It also contributes to the progression and severity of diseases such as Parkinson's and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.  Understanding neuroinflammation is crucial for developing targeted therapies.  Reducing neuroinflammation could potentially slow down or halt disease progression.  However, managing neuroinflammation is complex due to its dual nature.",Definition
