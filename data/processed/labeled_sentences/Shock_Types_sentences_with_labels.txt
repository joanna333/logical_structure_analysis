"Septic shock is triggered by an overwhelming infection that releases toxins into the bloodstream, damaging blood vessels and causing widespread vasodilation.",Definition
"Unlike hypovolemic shock, septic shock involves excessive vasodilation despite adequate blood volume.",Comparison
"While hypovolemic shock is characterized by low blood volume, cardiogenic shock is about the heart's inability to pump, and septic shock is about systemic infection causing vascular damage.",Contrast
"Treatment for hypovolemic shock includes fluid resuscitation, for cardiogenic shock it involves managing the underlying heart issue, and for septic shock, antibiotics are crucial alongside vasopressors to maintain blood pressure.",Addition
