"Chronic kidney disease (CKD) involves several pathophysiological changes, including -[Cause and Effect]- the progressive loss of nephron function over months or years. This loss leads to  accumulation of waste products and excess fluid in the body, which is  a key symptom of CKD. The kidneys fail to  filter blood effectively, which -[Cause and Effect]- results in a buildup of waste products like urea and creatinine.",Causal
"As CKD progresses,  the glomeruli become damaged, reducing the kidneys' ability to reabsorb essential substances like sodium, potassium, and phosphate, leading to -[Cause and Effect]- imbalances that affect other body systems. The  impaired filtration also means that the kidneys cannot secrete waste products efficiently, contributing to their accumulation.",Elaboration
"Systemic effects of CKD include  hypertension, anemia, and bone disease, all of which are  directly linked to the kidneys' reduced function. The  increased retention of erythropoietin due to renal failure leads to anemia, while high blood pressure is partly due to the retention of sodium and water.",Generalization
"Moreover, CKD can lead to -[Problem Solution]- acid-base imbalances, as the kidneys are less able to excrete hydrogen ions, which can be  corrected through dietary adjustments or medication. The  systemic effects of CKD underscore the importance of early detection and management to slow disease progression and improve quality of life.",Explanation
