Sentence,Label
Motor units are the basic functional units of skeletal muscles.,Definition
Each motor unit consists of a motor neuron and the muscle fibers it innervates.,Definition
The size of the motor unit determines the strength and precision of the muscle contraction.,Explanation
"Smaller motor units are more precise, allowing for fine movements, while larger ones are used for powerful contractions.",Comparison
The brain controls the activation of motor units through neural signals.,Explanation
The coordinated firing of multiple motor units leads to the contraction of the entire muscle.,Sequential
Understanding motor units is crucial for explaining how muscles generate force and how movements are controlled.,Explanation
"Motor unit recruitment is a key process in muscle physiology, where larger units are activated as needed for increased force output.",Explanation
This recruitment strategy ensures that muscles can perform a wide range of tasks from delicate finger movements to heavy lifting.,Explanation
"Thus, motor units play a critical role in muscle function and movement control.",Emphasis
