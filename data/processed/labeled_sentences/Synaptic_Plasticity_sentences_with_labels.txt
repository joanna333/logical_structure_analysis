"Synaptic plasticity is a fundamental neural process.  It refers to the ability of synapses to strengthen or weaken over time in response to activity.  This mechanism is crucial for learning and memory.  When two neurons frequently fire together, the connection between them, the synapse, becomes stronger, a phenomenon known as long-term potentiation. -[Cause and Effect] Conversely, if they rarely fire together, the synapse can weaken, a process called long-term depression. -[Cause and Effect] Synaptic plasticity allows the brain to adapt and modify its connections based on experience, which is essential for learning new information and retaining memories.  For instance, when you learn a new skill, the relevant neural pathways are reinforced through synaptic strengthening.  On the other hand, if you don't practice a skill, those pathways may weaken, leading to memory loss.  This plasticity is distinct from developmental synaptic pruning, which occurs early in life and shapes the brain's architecture.  While pruning sets the stage for learning, plasticity is the ongoing process that adapts the brain to new experiences.  Synaptic plasticity is not a static process; it is dynamic and essential for the brain's ability to change and learn throughout life.  Without this plasticity, learning would be limited to the initial wiring of the brain, and the ability to adapt to new situations would be severely restricted.  In summary, synaptic plasticity is a key mechanism that underlies learning and memory, allowing the brain to modify its structure",Definition
