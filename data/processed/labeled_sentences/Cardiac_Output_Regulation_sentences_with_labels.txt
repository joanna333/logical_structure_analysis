Sentence,Label
"Cardiac output is influenced by several factors, including heart rate, stroke volume, and vascular resistance.",Definition
"Stroke volume, the amount of blood ejected with each heartbeat, also plays a crucial role in regulating cardiac output.",Definition
The body senses the increased demand for oxygen during exercise and adjusts these factors to maintain adequate cardiac output.,Explanation
"The autonomic nervous system, specifically the sympathetic nervous system, increases heart rate to elevate cardiac output.",Explanation
"At the same time, hormones like epinephrine and norepinephrine are released, which also increase heart rate and stroke volume.",Addition
"These hormonal changes are a response to the increased demand for blood flow to active muscles, illustrating the body's complex regulation system.",Illustration
The body's feedback mechanisms ensure that cardiac output remains within a functional range during exercise.,Explanation
"In summary, cardiac output is regulated during exercise through the coordinated increase of heart rate, stroke volume, and the reduction of vascular resistance.",Summary
Understanding these factors and their relationships is key to comprehending how the body maintains adequate circulation during physical activity.,Purpose
