"At high altitudes, the air pressure is lower, which means there is less oxygen available. -[Cause and Effect]- To compensate, the body undergoes several physiological adaptations. One adaptation is an increase in red blood cell production.  This process, known as erythropoiesis, is triggered by the hormone erythropoietin, which signals the bone marrow to produce more red blood cells.  These red blood cells are crucial for oxygen delivery because they carry oxygen through the bloodstream.  The concentration of hemoglobin, the oxygen-carrying protein in red blood cells, often increases as well.  Furthermore, breathing rate increases to take in more oxygen, and the body produces more oxygen-carrying molecules, such as hemoglobin.  This adjustment in blood composition and breathing patterns helps maintain adequate oxygen delivery to tissues.  These changes are essential for survival at high altitudes, where the body must adapt to the reduced oxygen levels.",Explanation
