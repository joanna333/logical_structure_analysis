"The physiological stress response, also known as the  fight or flight  response, is a fundamental adaptive mechanism that prepares the body to either confront or flee from perceived threats"
This response is orchestrated by the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and the sympathetic nervous system (SNS)
"At the heart of this response are adrenal hormones, particularly cortisol and adrenaline (also known as epinephrine), which play critical roles in mobilizing the body's resources to cope with stress"
Cortisol is often referred to as the  stress hormone  because its levels increase significantly during stress
"Secreted by the adrenal glands, cortisol functions to increase blood sugar through gluconeogenesis, providing energy for immediate use by the muscles"
"It also plays a role in reducing inflammation, which can be beneficial in acute situations but is harmful if chronically elevated"
"Cortisol helps to dampen certain processes that would otherwise be energetically expensive or distracting during stress, such as immune response and growth processes"
"Adrenaline, on the other hand, is a hormone and a neurotransmitter produced primarily by the adrenal medulla"
"Upon detection of a stressor, the sympathetic nervous system sends signals to the adrenal glands to release adrenaline into the bloodstream"
"Adrenaline's effects are more immediate and dramatic; it stimulates the heart rate, dilates the airways, and increases blood flow to muscles, thereby preparing the body for rapid physical action"
"It also enhances the speed and alertness of reaction, which is why it is sometimes called the  fight or flight hormone"
The combined action of cortisol and adrenaline during the stress response ensures that the body is well-equipped to handle the stressor
"Cortisol provides a sustained energy source and modulates the immune system, while adrenaline offers a rapid boost of energy and heightened sensory awareness"
"However, prolonged or repeated activation of this stress response can lead to chronic stress, which can have deleterious effects on health due to sustained high levels of cortisol, such as impaired cognitive performance, suppressed immune function, and increased risk of cardiovascular diseases"
"In summary, the adrenal hormones cortisol and adrenaline are crucial components of the physiological stress response"
"Cortisol serves to provide a sustained energy source and regulate immune function, while adrenaline delivers a rapid, powerful boost to the body, preparing it to either confront or flee from perceived threats"
The delicate balance between these hormones is essential for maintaining homeostasis and ensuring the body can effectively deal with acute stressors
"However, their dysregulation in the context of chronic stress can have significant health implications"
