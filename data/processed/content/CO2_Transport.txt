Carbon dioxide (CO2) transport in the blood is a critical function that maintains the body's acid-base balance and ensures the proper functioning of various physiological processes
The blood contains three primary forms of CO2 transporters
"bicarbonate (HCO3-), carbamino compounds, and dissolved CO2 itself"
Understanding these transport mechanisms is essential for grasping how CO2 is carried in the blood and how it influences the pH of body fluids
Bicarbonate (HCO3-)
- Role
The most significant and immediate form of CO2 transport in the blood is as bicarbonate
Approximately 60-70% of the total CO2 transported is in the form of bicarbonate
- Conversion Process
"In the red blood cells, CO2 diffuses from the blood plasma into the erythrocytes"
"Once inside, CO2 reacts with water to form carbonic acid (H2CO3) through the enzyme carbonic anhydrase"
The carbonic acid then dissociates into hydrogen ions (H+) and bicarbonate ions (HCO3-)
- Transport
"The bicarbonate ions are then transported out of the red blood cells into the plasma, where they help maintain the pH of the blood by buffering the hydrogen ions (H+)"
- Regulation
"The conversion of CO2 to HCO3- helps to prevent significant changes in blood pH, which is crucial for the proper functioning of metabolic processes and the transmission of nerve impulses"
Carbamino Compounds
- Role
"About 10-20% of CO2 is transported as carbamino compounds, which are formed by the combination of CO2 with the amino groups of proteins, particularly hemoglobin"
- Formation Process
"CO2 reacts with the terminal amino groups of hemoglobin and other proteins to form carbamino compounds, such as carbaminohemoglobin and various other protein-bound forms"
- Transport
"These carbamino compounds can carry CO2 within the red blood cells, facilitating its transport to the lungs for exhalation"
- Regulation
"The formation of carbamino compounds helps stabilize hemoglobin's oxygen-carrying capacity, preventing the oxygen-displacing effect of CO2"
Dissolved CO2 (CO2(aq))
- Role
"A small percentage (about 10%) of CO2 is transported as dissolved CO2 gas in the plasma, much like a gas dissolved in a liquid"
- Role in Acid-Base Balance
The dissolved CO2 contributes to the acidic nature of blood plasma by partially dissociating into hydrogen ions (H+) and bicarbonate ions (HCO3-) through the carbonate buffer system
- Transport
"The dissolved CO2 is transported throughout the blood, affecting the pH of body fluids"
"Together, these forms of CO2 transport ensure that CO2 is efficiently removed from tissues where it is produced (during metabolism) and transported to the lungs for exhalation"
"The lungs act as the primary site for CO2 removal, where the process is reversed"
"oxygen is inhaled, and CO2 is exhaled out of the body"
The balance between these transport mechanisms is tightly regulated to maintain the blood's pH within a narrow range (7
35-7
"45), which is crucial for the proper functioning of all body systems"
"Disruptions in this balance can lead to acid-base disorders, which may have severe consequences for health and well-being"
