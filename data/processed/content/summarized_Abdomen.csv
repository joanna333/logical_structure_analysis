Abdomen,"The abdomen is the front part of the torso between the thorax chest and pelvis in humans and in other vertebrates. The area occupied by the abdomen is called the abdominal cavity. In arthropods it is the posterior tagma of the body it follows theThorax or cephalothorax. The abdomen is a large body cavity enclosed by the abdominal muscles at the front and to the sides and by part of the vertebral column at the back. The boundary of the abdominal cavity is the abdominal wall in front and the peritoneal surface at the rear. The abdominal cavity is continuous with and above the pelvic cavity. It is attached to the thoracic cavity by the diaphragm. Both the abdominal and pelvic cavities are lined by a serous membrane known as the parietal peritoneum. The abdomen in vertebrates contains a number of organs belonging to the digestive system and urinary system. The abdominal cavity contains most organs of the digestive system including the stomach, small intestine and the colon with its attached appendix. Other digestive organs are known as the accessory digestive organs and include the liver its attached gallbladder and the pancreas and these communicate with the rest of the system via various ducts. The abdomen contains an extensive membrane called the peritoneum. vessels including the aorta and inferior vena cava. The urinary bladder uterus fallopian tubes and ovaries may be seen as either abdominal organs or as pelvic organs. The kidneys and ureters are known as retroperitoneal organs The abdominal wall is made up of four layers. The first three layers extend between the vertebral column the lower ribs the iliac crest and pubis of the hip. All of their fibers merge towards the midline and surround the rectus abdominis in a sheath before joining up on the opposite side. The transverse abdominal muscle is flat and triangular with its fibers running horizontally. It originates from the inguinal ligament costal cartilages 712 the iliac crest and thoracolumbar fascia. The muscle is crossed by three fibrous bands called the tendinous bands.  rectus abdominis is enclosed in a thick sheath formed by fibers from each of the three muscles of the lateral abdominal wall. fibers originate at the pubis bone run up the abdomen and insert into the cartilages of the fifth sixth and seventh ribs. In the region of the groin the inguinal canal is a passage through the layers. The pyramidalis muscle is located in the lower abdomen in front of the rectus abdominis. "
