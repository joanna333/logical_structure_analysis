The cardiac cycle is a sequence of events that occur within the heart during one complete heartbeat
This cycle consists of two major phases
"atrial systole (contraction) and ventricular systole (contraction), separated by the relaxation phases of diastole"
"The cardiac cycle is orchestrated by an intricate balance between electrical conduction and mechanical contraction, which together ensure an efficient cardiac output—the amount of blood ejected from the heart in one minute"
### Electrical Conduction
The electrical conduction system of the heart is responsible for initiating and propagating electrical impulses (action potentials) that ultimately lead to contraction of the heart muscle
"This system is comprised of specialized cells called pacemaker cells, found in the sinoatrial (SA) node, which is located in the right atrium"
"The SA node generates an intrinsic rhythm, setting the pace for the heart"
SA Node Depolarization
"The cycle begins when the SA node depolarizes, initiating an electrical impulse"
"This wave of depolarization spreads across the atrial walls, causing them to contract"
Atrioventricular (AV) Node
"The electrical signal then travels to the atrioventricular (AV) node, which acts as a delay to ensure that the atria finish contracting before the ventricles begin to contract"
Bundle of His and Purkinje Fibers
"From the AV node, the impulse travels down the bundle of His and then splits into left and right bundles"
"These fibers distribute the electrical signal to the Purkinje fibers, which then conduct the impulse throughout the ventricular walls"
### Mechanical Contraction
The mechanical contraction phase follows the electrical depolarization
This phase involves the coordinated contraction of cardiac muscle fibers
Ventricular Depolarization
"After the ventricles are depolarized by the Purkinje fibers, they begin to contract"
Isovolumetric Contraction
"Initially, as the ventricular muscles contract, the heart valves close"
"During this phase, the volume within the ventricles remains constant because the pressure increases rapidly and no blood is ejected from the heart"
Ejection Phase
"As the pressure in the ventricles exceeds the pressure in the aorta and the pulmonary artery, the semilunar valves (aortic and pulmonary) open, allowing blood to be ejected into these arteries"
"This phase continues until the ventricular pressure drops below the systemic and pulmonary arterial pressures, at which point the semilunar valves close"
"### Dependency Between Electrical Conduction, Mechanical Contraction, and Cardiac Output"
"The precise timing and coordination of electrical conduction and mechanical contraction are critical for maintaining cardiac output, which is the amount of blood ejected by the heart in one minute"
- Dependence on Electrical Conduction
The regular and coordinated spread of electrical impulses ensures the synchronized contraction of the atria and ventricles
"Any disruption in this process, such as arrhythmias, can lead to inefficient contraction and reduced cardiac output"
- Dependence on Mechanical Contraction
The force and efficiency of contraction directly influence the cardiac output
"The more forcefully and efficiently the ventricles contract, the greater the volume of blood they can eject"
"Disorders like cardiomyopathy, which affect the heart muscle's ability to contract, can significantly reduce cardiac output"
- Cardiac Output
Cardiac output is determined by the heart rate (how many times the heart beats per minute) and the stroke volume (the amount of blood ejected with each heartbeat)
"An increase in either heart rate or stroke volume increases cardiac output, but this balance relies on the precise timing and synchrony between electrical and mechanical events"
"In summary, the cardiac cycle is a finely tuned process where electrical conduction initiates and coordinates the mechanical contraction of the heart muscle"
"This coordination ensures optimal cardiac output, meeting the body’s demand for oxygen-rich blood"
Any disruption in this intricate system can lead to various heart conditions and reduced efficiency in fulfilling the body's needs
