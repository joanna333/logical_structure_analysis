"Fertilization occurs when a sperm cell merges with an egg cell, commonly known as the ovum"
The fusion of these cells marks the beginning of early embryonic development
"Ovulation, the release of the egg from the ovary, is triggered by a surge in luteinizing hormone (LH)"
"After fertilization, the zygote begins to divide through mitosis, a process known as cleavage"
"The blastula stage follows, where the single-celled zygote transforms into a multicellular structure"
"The blastula will eventually implant into the uterine wall, where it receives essential nutrients and hormonal support"
"Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), produced by the placenta, maintains the corpus luteum, which continues progesterone production"
Progesterone and estrogen are crucial hormones that prepare the uterus for implantation and support the early pregnancy
"Without these hormonal supports, the embryo might not survive and develop properly"
"Thus, hormonal balance is vital for successful fertilization and early embryonic development"
"In summary, fertilization initiates a complex process that requires precise hormonal timing and support"
