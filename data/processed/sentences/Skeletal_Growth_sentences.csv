Skeletal growth involves several key processes:
"- Bones are made of a framework of collagen and minerals, primarily calcium phosphate, which harden to provide strength"
"- Growth plates, located at the ends of long bones, are areas of active growth where cartilage is replaced by bone"
"- The process of bone remodeling is essential for skeletal growth, where old bone is removed and new bone is laid down"
"- Hormones play a crucial role in regulating these processes; for instance, growth hormone stimulates bone growth directly"
"- The pituitary gland secretes growth hormone, which signals the liver to produce insulin-like growth factors (IGFs), which then stimulate bone growth"
"- Without adequate levels of these hormones, skeletal growth can be stunted, leading to conditions like dwarfism or gigantism"
"- During puberty, increased levels of sex hormones like estrogen and testosterone further stimulate bone growth"
- This hormonal regulation ensures that bones grow at appropriate rates and reach their full adult length
"In summary, skeletal growth is a complex process regulated by hormones, which work in a coordinated manner to ensure bones develop correctly"
