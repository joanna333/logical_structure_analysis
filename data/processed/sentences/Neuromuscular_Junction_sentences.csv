"When a motor neuron is activated, it sends an electrical impulse,  known as an action potential, down its axon"
"At the neuromuscular junction, this action potential triggers the release of acetylcholine,  a neurotransmitter, from the motor neuron's synaptic vesicles"
"Acetylcholine then crosses the synaptic gap and binds to nicotinic receptors on the muscle cell membrane,  initiating a change in the membrane's permeability"
"This change allows sodium ions to enter the muscle cell,  starting an action potential in the muscle fiber"
"The action potential then travels along the muscle fiber,  causing the muscle to contract"
"The contraction ceases when acetylcholine is broken down by the enzyme acetylcholinesterase,  ending the signal between the neuron and muscle cell"
"Thus, the sequence of events at the neuromuscular junction is crucial for muscle contraction,  highlighting the importance of neurotransmission in this process"
