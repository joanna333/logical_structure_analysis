Muscle fatigue occurs for several reasons
"One cause is prolonged physical activity, which leads to a depletion of energy sources in the muscles"
"Another cause is the buildup of metabolic byproducts such as lactic acid, which can interfere with muscle function"
The physiological adaptations to muscle fatigue include increased blood flow to carry away waste products
Muscles also experience changes in ion exchange across the cell membrane to maintain electrical potential
"Additionally, there is an increase in the production of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to replenish energy stores"
These adaptations help muscles continue to function despite fatigue
Muscle fibers rely on a constant supply of oxygen and nutrients to sustain contraction
"When these supplies are depleted, muscle fatigue sets in"
The body responds by recruiting more muscle fibers and increasing the heart rate to enhance blood flow
"This process, however, can only compensate for a certain period before fatigue becomes inevitable"
"Muscles also adapt by switching to anaerobic metabolism, which produces lactic acid as a byproduct"
Lactic acid accumulation can lead to muscle burning and decreased muscle contractility
Muscle fatigue is not just a local phenomenon within the muscle but involves the nervous system as well
The central nervous system may limit muscle activation to prevent further damage
This protective mechanism is a form of negative feedback where the brain senses excessive fatigue and reduces neural drive to the muscles -[Cause and
