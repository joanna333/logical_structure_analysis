"Platelets play a crucial role in hemostasis, the process of stopping bleeding"
"When a blood vessel is injured, platelets are the first to respond"
Platelets adhere to the vessel wall at the site of injury
This adherence is followed by shape change and aggregation of platelets
Aggregated platelets form a plug that helps seal the break in the vessel
The plug prevents further blood loss by forming a temporary barrier
Platelets also release substances that promote clot formation
These substances include clotting factors that further stabilize the clot
"Without adequate platelets, clot formation can be impaired, leading to increased bleeding risk"
"Thus, platelets are essential for hemostasis and maintaining normal blood coagulation"
