"Natural killer (NK) cells play a crucial role in the immune response by identifying and destroying infected or abnormal cells, such as cancer cells and virus-infected cells, without directly recognizing specific antigens"
NK cells are a type of innate immune cells that do not need to be activated by antibodies like B cells or T cells do
"When NK cells detect stressed or compromised cells, they release cytotoxic granules that contain perforin and granzymes, which kill the target cell by inducing apoptosis"
"The activation of NK cells is regulated by the balance of inhibitory and activating receptors on their surface, which recognize MHC molecules on the surface of cells"
"If the inhibitory signals are stronger, NK cells remain inactive; however, if the activating signals outweigh the inhibitory ones, NK cells are activated to kill the target cell"
NK cells are essential for the rapid initial response against viral infections before the adaptive immune system can be fully mobilized
"In contrast to adaptive immunity, which is highly specific, NK cells provide a broad defense mechanism against a wide range of pathogens"
The presence of NK cells is vital for maintaining homeostasis and preventing the spread of infections and development of tumors
"In summary, NK cells are critical for the immune system's ability to quickly eliminate compromised cells, providing a first line of defense against infections and cancer"
The understanding of NK cell function is crucial for developing therapies that enhance or suppress their activity
