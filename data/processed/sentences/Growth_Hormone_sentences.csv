Growth hormone (GH) plays a crucial role in growth and metabolism
"When released, it stimulates growth and cell reproduction"
GH also affects how the body uses fat and carbohydrates for energy
"In children, it is essential for linear growth"
"In adults, it helps maintain muscle mass and bone density"
"GH influences how the body metabolizes proteins, which are important for tissue repair"
"Insufficient GH can lead to growth disorders, while excess can cause gigantism in children"
"Lack of GH can result in slower growth rates, while its presence ensures normal growth"
"Initially, GH stimulates growth directly, and later, it maintains body composition"
These effects underscore GH's importance in overall health and development
Understanding GH's effects helps in diagnosing and treating related disorders
"Growth hormone is vital for growth and metabolism, influencing various bodily processes"
The physiological effects of growth hormone on growth and metabolism are significant
It stimulates growth directly in children and indirectly in adults by maintaining muscle and bone mass
"While GH is crucial for childhood growth, its role shifts to maintenance in adults"
"In both stages of life, GH affects how the body uses nutrients, but the outcomes differ"
"In children, GH causes direct growth; in adults, it prevents loss"
"GH also impacts how the body uses fats and carbs, affecting energy levels"
