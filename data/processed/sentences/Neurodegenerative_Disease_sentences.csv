"Neurodegenerative diseases, like Alzheimer's, cause significant physiological changes in the brain"
These diseases lead to the death of neurons over time
Alzheimer's is characterized by the buildup of amyloid-beta plaques and tau protein tangles
The cognitive decline in Alzheimer's is directly linked to these pathological changes
Memory loss and confusion are early symptoms due to these physiological alterations
Neurofibrillary tangles and reduced synaptic connections are also observed
"Contrastingly, healthy brains maintain a balance of synaptic activity and neuronal integrity"
"The progression of Alzheimer's is not reversible, highlighting the importance of early intervention"
Research aims to understand these physiological changes to develop effective treatments
Identifying the cause of these changes is crucial for potential therapies
"Several risk factors, including genetics and lifestyle, contribute to the onset of Alzheimer's"
The accumulation of beta-amyloid proteins is a key factor in the disease process
Understanding these physiological changes helps in developing diagnostic tools
The brain shrinkage seen in Alzheimer's is a visible sign of extensive neuronal loss
These changes ultimately impair brain function and lead to dementia
"Despite ongoing research, the exact mechanism of neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's remains elusive"
