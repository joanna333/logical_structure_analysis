The gastrointestinal reflexes are automatic responses that occur within the digestive system
"The enteric nervous system plays a crucial role in controlling these reflexes, functioning independently within the gut"
"The autonomic nervous system, on the other hand, influences the enteric nervous system to regulate digestion in response to various internal and external stimuli"
"For instance, the sight or smell of food can trigger the release of digestive enzymes, which is a response mediated by the autonomic nervous system influencing the enteric nervous system"
Both systems work together to ensure proper digestion and absorption of nutrients
"-[Co-ordination]- When there is a dysfunction in these reflexes, it can lead to gastrointestinal disorders"
Understanding these systems is essential for diagnosing and treating digestive issues
