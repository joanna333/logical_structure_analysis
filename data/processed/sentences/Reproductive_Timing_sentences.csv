"Hormonal regulation plays a crucial role in the timing of reproductive events, ensuring that these events occur in a precise order"
"' Without hormones, the body would not be able to coordinate the complex processes involved in reproduction"
"The pituitary gland and ovaries, for example, work together to control the menstrual cycle, with hormones like estrogen and progesterone influencing the timing of ovulation and menstruation"
"' When hormone levels drop, the uterus lining sheds, leading to menstruation"
"Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) from the pituitary gland stimulates the growth of follicles in the ovaries, which in turn produce estrogen"
"' Estrogen, in turn, signals the pituitary gland to stop producing FSH, preventing overgrowth of the follicles"
"Luteinizing hormone (LH) from the pituitary gland then triggers ovulation, the release of an egg from the ovary"
"' After ovulation, the empty follicle transforms into the corpus luteum, which secretes progesterone, preparing the uterus for potential pregnancy"
"If pregnancy does not occur, progesterone levels drop, signaling the start of menstruation"
' This decline in progesterone is essential for shedding the uterine lining and starting a new cycle
"Hormonal regulation ensures that these events are timed correctly, maintaining the reproductive system's health and readiness for potential fertilization"
' Any disruption in this hormonal balance can lead to reproductive issues
"In summary, hormones act as messengers"
