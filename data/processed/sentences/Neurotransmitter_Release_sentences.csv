Neurotransmitters are released at synapses through a complex process
"The release is triggered by an electrical impulse, known as an action potential, which travels down the axon of the presynaptic neuron"
"When the action potential reaches the axon terminal, it causes calcium ions to flow into the terminal"
"Calcium influx then triggers the fusion of synaptic vesicles with the presynaptic membrane, releasing neurotransmitters into the synaptic cleft"
"This release is controlled by a mechanism called exocytosis, which ensures that neurotransmitters are precisely released in response to neuronal activity"
"Receptors on the postsynaptic neuron bind to the released neurotransmitters, initiating a new electrical signal if the neurotransmitters are excitatory, or inhibiting the signal if they are inhibitory"
"The binding of neurotransmitters to their receptors is highly specific, maintaining the integrity and functionality of synaptic communication"
"To terminate the signal, neurotransmitters are either reabsorbed by the presynaptic neuron (reuptake) or broken down by enzymes in the synaptic cleft"
This reuptake and degradation prevent excessive stimulation of the postsynaptic neuron and ensure the synapse can reset for the next potential signal
"The entire process is finely tuned to ensure efficient and precise communication between neurons, which is crucial for normal brain function"
