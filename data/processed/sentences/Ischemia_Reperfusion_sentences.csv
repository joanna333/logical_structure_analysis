"Ischemia occurs when blood flow to a tissue or organ is restricted, leading to a lack of oxygen and nutrients"
"This lack of oxygen causes cells to switch to anaerobic metabolism, which produces lactic acid and contributes to cellular damage"
"Reperfusion injury happens when blood flow is restored after a period of ischemia, causing further cellular damage"
The restoration of blood flow leads to the release of harmful free radicals and activation of inflammatory pathways
"Free radicals can damage cell membranes and DNA, exacerbating the injury"
Inflammation can lead to further tissue damage and scarring
Reperfusion injury can worsen the initial ischemic damage and delay recovery
"Therefore, managing reperfusion injury is crucial to minimize the overall damage caused by ischemia"
"In summary, ischemia deprives tissues of oxygen, leading to cellular damage, and reperfusion injury exacerbates this damage through additional mechanisms"
