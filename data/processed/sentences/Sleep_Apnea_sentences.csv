Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) causes repeated interruptions in breathing during sleep due to airway obstruction
"Risk factors for OSA include being overweight, having a large neck circumference, and having a family history of the condition"
"Men are more likely to be diagnosed with OSA than women, although the risk increases in women after menopause"
Sleeping on your back can exacerbate OSA symptoms because it allows the tongue and soft palate to fall back and block the airway
"High blood pressure and type 2 diabetes are often associated with OSA, highlighting the condition's systemic effects"
"Central sleep apnea, though less common, occurs when the brain fails to send proper signals to the breathing muscles"
"Despite the differences, both obstructive and central sleep apnea share the risk factor of aging, as the muscles and brain functions can deteriorate over time"
Losing weight and changing sleep positions can reduce the severity of OSA symptoms for many patients
"It's crucial to recognize the signs of OSA, such as loud snoring and daytime sleepiness, to seek medical advice promptly"
"Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy is a common treatment for OSA, keeping the airways open during sleep"
"Even with treatment, some individuals may experience residual symptoms, underscoring the complexity of OSA management"
