Pulmonary hypertension is a condition where the blood pressure in the pulmonary artery rises above normal levels
This increase in pressure is primarily caused by the heart having to work harder to pump blood through the narrowed pulmonary arteries
The systemic effects of pulmonary hypertension are widespread and can be severe
"One systemic effect is right-heart failure, as the strain on the right ventricle increases"
"Additionally, patients may experience dizziness, fainting, and fatigue due to reduced blood flow to the body"
"The condition can also lead to peripheral edema, where fluid accumulates in the limbs, as the heart struggles to maintain adequate circulation"
"Pulmonary hypertension can worsen existing conditions like coronary artery disease or diabetes, complicating treatment"
Monitoring and managing pulmonary hypertension is crucial to prevent these systemic effects and improve quality of life
Understanding the pathophysiology and systemic effects helps in devising targeted treatments and management plans
"Therefore, early detection and intervention are key to mitigating the impact of pulmonary hypertension on overall health"
