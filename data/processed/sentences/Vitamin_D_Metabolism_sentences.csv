Vitamin D is a fat-soluble vitamin essential for human health
The synthesis of vitamin D begins with the exposure of skin to sunlight
"When ultraviolet B rays from the sun hit the skin, a precursor molecule, 7-dehydrocholesterol, transforms into previtamin D3"
This transformation is a crucial step in the activation process of vitamin D
"Once formed, previtamin D3 spontaneously converts to vitamin D3, the active form of vitamin D in the body"
"Vitamin D3 is then transported to the liver, where it is hydroxylated to form 25-hydroxyvitamin D, also known as calcidiol"
"The kidneys further convert calcidiol into its active form, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, or calcitriol"
"Active vitamin D regulates calcium and phosphorus homeostasis, which is vital for bone health"
A deficiency in vitamin D can lead to bone disorders such as rickets in children and osteomalacia in adults
"Vitamin D also plays a role in immune function, reducing the risk of autoimmune diseases"
Adequate vitamin D levels are also associated with improved muscle function and reduced falls in the elderly
"Therefore, maintaining adequate vitamin D levels is important for overall health"
"Understanding its synthesis, activation, and physiological"
