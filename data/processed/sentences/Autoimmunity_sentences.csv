"Autoimmunity occurs when the immune system mistakenly attacks the body's own tissues, mistaking them for foreign invaders"
The mechanisms leading to autoimmunity are complex and involve a breakdown in immune tolerance
"One key mechanism is genetic predisposition, where certain genes make individuals more susceptible to developing autoimmune diseases"
"Environmental factors, such as infections or chemicals, can trigger the onset of autoimmunity in genetically predisposed individuals"
"For example, in rheumatoid arthritis, the immune system attacks the joints, causing inflammation and pain"
"Another example is type 1 diabetes, where the immune system destroys the insulin-producing cells in the pancreas"
"Contrastingly, in lupus, the immune system targets the body's own tissues, leading to a wide range of symptoms"
Autoimmune diseases often share the characteristic of chronic inflammation and can affect various organs and systems
Understanding these mechanisms is crucial for developing better treatments and potentially preventing autoimmunity
Research into the immune system's balance between tolerance and response is essential for advancing our knowledge in autoimmunity
"In summary, autoimmunity is a result of a combination of genetic and environmental factors leading to the immune system attacking the body's own tissues"
"The problem of autoimmunity lies in the immune system's inability to distinguish self from non-self, leading to harmful inflammation and tissue damage"
