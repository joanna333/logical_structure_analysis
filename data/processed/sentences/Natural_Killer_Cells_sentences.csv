Natural killer (NK) cells play a crucial role in the immune system by identifying and destroying infected cells and tumor cells
The activation of NK cells is a complex process involving the integration of various signals
"When NK cells are activated, they release cytotoxic granules that kill the target cells"
The regulation of NK cells is tightly controlled to prevent excessive cell death and autoimmunity
Interferon gamma and interleukin-2 are two key cytokines that stimulate NK cell activity
"On the other hand, inhibitory receptors on NK cells recognize MHC molecules to prevent unnecessary killing of healthy cells"
"In contrast to T cells, NK cells do not require antigen presentation to recognize and eliminate targets"
NK cells are essential for the rapid initial response against viral infections and tumor development
Their regulation is crucial to maintain homeostasis and prevent immune system overreaction
Deficiencies in NK cell function can lead to increased susceptibility to certain infections and cancers
"In summary, natural killer cells are vital for immune defense, and their regulation is essential for preventing harmful effects"
Understanding the regulation of NK cells is key to developing therapies for immune disorders and cancer treatment
Clarifying the role and regulation of NK cells helps in identifying potential targets for immunotherapies
"NK cells, along with other immune cells, form a network of defense mechanisms in the body"
