The nephron adapts to changes in fluid or electrolyte balance through various feedback mechanisms
"When the body loses excess fluid, osmoreceptors in the hypothalamus detect the change, triggering the release of antidiuretic hormone (ADH)"
"ADH, also known as vasopressin, then signals the kidneys to reabsorb more water, preventing dehydration"
"On the other hand, if the body has too much fluid, the increased blood volume is sensed by baroreceptors in the arteries"
"This triggers the release of aldosterone from the adrenal glands, which promotes the reabsorption of sodium and water in the kidneys"
The nephron also adjusts based on the concentration of electrolytes in the filtrate
"For instance, when sodium levels are high, the distal convoluted tubule increases potassium excretion to maintain electrolyte balance"
These feedback mechanisms ensure that the internal environment remains stable despite fluctuations in intake and output
"In summary, the nephron and its regulatory hormones work together to maintain fluid and electrolyte balance through a series of feedback loops"
