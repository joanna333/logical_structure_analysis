The retina is a layer at the back of the eye that plays a crucial role in vision
The retina initially receives light through the eye's lens
"Once light hits the retina, it is converted into electrical signals"
These electrical signals then travel along the optic nerve to the brain
The brain processes these signals to form the visual image we perceive
"Without the retina's initial processing, the brain would not receive the necessary information to create vision"
"Thus, the retina is essential for converting light into visual information that the brain can interpret"
