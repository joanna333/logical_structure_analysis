"Fat-soluble vitamins, such as vitamins A, D, E, and K, are absorbed through the intestinal villi in a process that involves several steps"
"First, these vitamins are consumed and enter the digestive tract"
"Once in the small intestine, they bind to bile salts, which are secreted by the liver to aid in fat digestion"
"The presence of dietary fats is essential because these vitamins are fat-soluble, meaning they dissolve in fat"
"The mixed fats and vitamins form micelles, which are small spheres that help the vitamins move through the intestinal lining"
"These micelles then reach the villi, the finger-like projections in the small intestine that increase surface area for absorption"
"Here, the vitamins are absorbed into the lymphatic system through the villi cells, bypassing the need for intestinal digestion"
"The lymphatic system carries them directly to the bloodstream, allowing them to be distributed throughout the body for use"
"Water-soluble vitamins, including vitamins C and B complex, follow a different absorption pathway"
These vitamins are not absorbed through the intestinal villi like fat-soluble ones
"Instead, they remain in the intestinal tract until they come in contact with the intestinal walls"
"Once there, they are absorbed directly into the bloodstream through passive diffusion"
"The presence of water in the digestive system aids this process, as these vitamins are hydrophilic, meaning they dissolve in water"
The bloodstream quickly
