The inflammatory cascade begins withan injury or infection triggering the release of chemical mediators
"The key mediators include histamine, bradykinin, prostaglandins, and leukotrienes"
"Histaminereleased by mast cells, increases vascular permeability, allowing fluid and white blood cells to move into the tissues"
"Bradykininanother mediator, enhances vasodilation and increases vascular permeability, contributing to swelling"
"Prostaglandinsincrease pain sensitivity and vasodilation, amplifying the inflammatory response"
"Leukotrienesconstrict bronchioles and increase vascular permeability, playing a role in allergic reactions"
"Following the release of these mediators, the endothelial cells express adhesion molecules, attracting leukocytes to the site"
"The recruited leukocytes, such as neutrophils and macrophages, thenrelease enzymes and reactive oxygen species to destroy pathogens"
"This process also attracts more immune cells and activates the complement system, which marks pathogens for destruction"
The inflammatory responseis a complex and coordinated series of events aimed at removing harmful stimuli and initiating tissue repair
The key mediators and steps are crucial for understanding how the body responds to acute inflammation
"In summary, the inflammatory cascade involves the release of mediators like histamine and bradykinin, which lead to increased vascular permeability and the recruitment"
