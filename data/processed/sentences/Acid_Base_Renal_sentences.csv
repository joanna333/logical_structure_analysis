The kidneys play a crucial role in regulating acid-base homeostasis in the body
"They achieve this by excreting hydrogen ions, which are responsible for acidity"
"Simultaneously, the kidneys reabsorb bicarbonate, a base, back into the bloodstream"
This dual process helps to maintain the proper pH balance
Excreting hydrogen ions and reabsorbing bicarbonate are separate mechanisms that work together
The excretion of hydrogen ions is essential to rid the body of excess acid
"Reabsorbing bicarbonate increases the bicarbonate concentration in the blood, which acts as a buffer against acids"
"If the kidneys fail to perform these functions adequately, acid-base imbalances can occur"
The precise regulation of hydrogen ions and bicarbonate is vital for maintaining life
"In summary, the kidneys manage acid-base homeostasis by excreting hydrogen ions and reabsorbing bicarbonate, ensuring the body's pH remains stable"
