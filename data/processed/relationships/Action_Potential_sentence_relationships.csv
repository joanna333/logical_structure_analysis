Explanation: Sentence 1 explains why understanding the generation and propagation of action potentials in neurons is crucial. It outlines the causal relationship between these processes and the functioning of the nervous system. Sentence 2 provides more detailed information about the specific process mentioned in Sentence 1—the generation of an action potential—which is a key component of how neurons function within the nervous system. Together, these sentences establish that the generation of action potentials is a fundamental mechanism that leads to the functioning of the nervous system, reinforcing the causal relationship."

Explanation:

The second sentence explains the consequence (or effect) of the action described in the first sentence. When ""Synaptic Transmission"" occurs, it leads to the specific action of ""Once the action potential reaches the axon terminal, it triggers the release of neurotransmitters into the synaptic cleft."" This sequence is causal because the first event (Synaptic Transmission) directly results in the second event (release of neurotransmitters). The explanation provided clarifies how the process of synaptic transmission leads to the release of neurotransmitters, establishing a causal relationship between the two sentences."
