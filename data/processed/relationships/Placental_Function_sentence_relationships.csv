The placenta's role in waste management is crucial for maintaining the health and stability of the fetal environment,### Hormonal Regulation,Explanation
### Hormonal Regulation,"The placenta is a dynamic endocrine organ, producing a variety of hormones that are essential for maintaining pregnancy",Explanation
"The placenta is a dynamic endocrine organ, producing a variety of hormones that are essential for maintaining pregnancy","Key hormones include human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), progesterone, and estrogen",Explanation
"Key hormones include human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), progesterone, and estrogen","These hormones support the continuation of the pregnancy by suppressing maternal immune responses, preparing the breasts for lactation, and maintaining the uterine lining, ensuring that it remains ready for the implantation of a fertilized egg and subsequent development of the fetus",Explanation
"These hormones support the continuation of the pregnancy by suppressing maternal immune responses, preparing the breasts for lactation, and maintaining the uterine lining, ensuring that it remains ready for the implantation of a fertilized egg and subsequent development of the fetus",### Maternal-Fetal Immunity,Explanation
### Maternal-Fetal Immunity,The placenta serves as a protective barrier against pathogens and other harmful substances,Explanation
The placenta serves as a protective barrier against pathogens and other harmful substances,It does this by acting as a physical barrier and by secreting immunoglobulins (antibodies) from the fetus that pass into the mother's bloodstream,Explanation
It does this by acting as a physical barrier and by secreting immunoglobulins (antibodies) from the fetus that pass into the mother's bloodstream,"This process, known as passive immunity transfer, provides the fetus with a temporary immune system boost during gestation",Explanation
"This process, known as passive immunity transfer, provides the fetus with a temporary immune system boost during gestation","Additionally, the placenta modifies the maternal immune response to prevent it from attacking the fetus, a condition known as rejection",Explanation
"Additionally, the placenta modifies the maternal immune response to prevent it from attacking the fetus, a condition known as rejection",### Regulation of Nutrient Availability,Explanation
