Sentence 1 explains that synaptic efficacy, or the strength of a synapse, is not fixed and can change due to various factors such as repeated activation, learning experiences, and environmental changes. It provides an overview of how synaptic strength can be modulated.

Sentence 2 specifically refers to ""Long-Term Potentiation"" (LTP), which is a phenomenon of synaptic enhancement that occurs at excitatory synapses in the brain following prolonged activation. LTP is one of the primary neural mechanisms that underlies learning and memory and is a key example of how synaptic strength can be increased through specific forms of activity, fitting within the broader context described in Sentence 1.
