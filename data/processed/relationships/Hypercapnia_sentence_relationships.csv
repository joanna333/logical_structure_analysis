Hyperventilation,"As mentioned, the primary initial response to elevated CO2 levels is to breathe more rapidly and deeply to expel the excess CO2",Explanation
"As mentioned, the primary initial response to elevated CO2 levels is to breathe more rapidly and deeply to expel the excess CO2",Hypoxic Drive,Explanation
Hypoxic Drive,"In hypercapnic conditions, the body becomes more sensitive to the buildup of CO2, relying more on the concentration of CO2 and less on oxygen (PaO2) to regulate breathing","Explanation. 

The sentence ""In hypercapnic conditions, the body becomes more sensitive to the buildup of CO2, relying more on the concentration of CO2 and less on oxygen (PaO2) to regulate breathing"" explains the concept of ""Hypoxic Drive."" The term ""Hypoxic Drive"" refers to a controversial theory that suggests patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) breathe more to eliminate CO2 rather than to fulfill oxygen (O2) needs. However, the provided sentence from Sentence 2 explains a physiological response to hypercapnia (excess CO2) where the body's regulation of breathing changes under these conditions.

Therefore, Sentence 2 explains the underlying physiological mechanism that leads to the concept of ""Hypoxic Drive"" as described in Sentence 1. The relationship between the two sentences is Explanation."
