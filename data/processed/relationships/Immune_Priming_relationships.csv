Sentence 1,Sentence 2,Relationship
The immune system is initially challenged during an infection or vaccination,This challenge triggers a series of responses to protect the body,Cause and Effect
This challenge triggers a series of responses to protect the body,"Upon encountering a pathogen, the immune system recognizes it as foreign",Cause and Effect
"Upon encountering a pathogen, the immune system recognizes it as foreign",This recognition is crucial for initiating a defense mechanism,Cause and Effect
This recognition is crucial for initiating a defense mechanism,The immune system then activates immune cells like B cells and T cells,Cause and Effect
The immune system then activates immune cells like B cells and T cells,These cells are primed to identify and combat the specific pathogen,Cause and Effect
These cells are primed to identify and combat the specific pathogen,B cells begin to produce antibodies tailored to the invader,Cause and Effect
B cells begin to produce antibodies tailored to the invader,These antibodies help neutralize the pathogen,Cause and Effect
These antibodies help neutralize the pathogen,"T cells, on the other hand, can destroy infected cells and memory T cells are formed",Cause and Effect
"T cells, on the other hand, can destroy infected cells and memory T cells are formed",These memory cells ensure a faster response if the pathogen reappears,Cause and Effect
These memory cells ensure a faster response if the pathogen reappears,The process is not only about fighting the current infection but also about building immunity,Cause and Effect
The process is not only about fighting the current infection but also about building immunity,This priming during the initial infection or vaccination lays the groundwork for future protection,Cause and Effect
This priming during the initial infection or vaccination lays the groundwork for future protection,"In summary, the immune system is primed by recognizing the pathogen, activating specific cells, producing antibodies, and forming memory cells",Cause and Effect
"In summary, the immune system is primed by recognizing the pathogen, activating specific cells, producing antibodies, and forming memory cells",This complex process prepares the body to defend against future attacks,Cause and Effect
This complex process prepares the body to defend against future attacks,"Thus, the initial infection or vaccination is not just about immediate defense but also about long-term immune readiness",Cause and Effect
"Thus, the initial infection or vaccination is not just about immediate defense but also about long-term immune readiness",This priming is essential for maintaining health and preventing recurrent infections,Cause and Effect
