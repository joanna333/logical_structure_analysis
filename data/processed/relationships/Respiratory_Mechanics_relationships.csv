Sentence 1,Sentence 2,Relationship
Breathing involves the movement of air into and out of the lungs,"The lungs have a certain degree of compliance, which means they can expand and contract easily",Cause and Effect
"The lungs have a certain degree of compliance, which means they can expand and contract easily",Airway resistance plays a crucial role in breathing; it affects how easily air can flow through the respiratory tract,Cause and Effect
Airway resistance plays a crucial role in breathing; it affects how easily air can flow through the respiratory tract,"When the diaphragm contracts, it increases the chest cavity's volume, which lowers lung compliance temporarily",Cause and Effect
"When the diaphragm contracts, it increases the chest cavity's volume, which lowers lung compliance temporarily","Lowering lung compliance creates a negative pressure, drawing air into the lungs",Cause and Effect
"Lowering lung compliance creates a negative pressure, drawing air into the lungs","Airway resistance is higher in narrower passages, making breathing more difficult",Cause and Effect
"Airway resistance is higher in narrower passages, making breathing more difficult","If airway resistance increases, more pressure is needed to move air into the lungs",Cause and Effect
"If airway resistance increases, more pressure is needed to move air into the lungs",Compliance and airway resistance work together to ensure efficient gas exchange,Cause and Effect
Compliance and airway resistance work together to ensure efficient gas exchange,"Despite resistance, the lungs' compliance allows them to expand and fill with air",Cause and Effect
"Despite resistance, the lungs' compliance allows them to expand and fill with air",Understanding these mechanics helps in diagnosing breathing disorders,Cause and Effect
Understanding these mechanics helps in diagnosing breathing disorders,Breathing is a continuous process relying on the balance of lung compliance and airway resistance,Cause and Effect
Breathing is a continuous process relying on the balance of lung compliance and airway resistance,Breathing problems can occur if either compliance or resistance is compromised,Cause and Effect
Breathing problems can occur if either compliance or resistance is compromised,"For instance, in asthma, airway resistance increases, making breathing harder",Cause and Effect
"For instance, in asthma, airway resistance increases, making breathing harder","On the other hand, emphysema reduces lung compliance, also impeding breathing",Cause and Effect
"On the other hand, emphysema reduces lung compliance, also impeding breathing","Thus, both factors are essential for normal, effortless breathing",Cause and Effect
"Thus, both factors are essential for normal, effortless breathing",Efforts to improve breathing often focus on reducing airway resistance and enhancing lung compliance,Cause and Effect
