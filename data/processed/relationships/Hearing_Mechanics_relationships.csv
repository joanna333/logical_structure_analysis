Sentence 1,Sentence 2,Relationship
The cochlea is a snail-shaped structure in the inner ear crucial for hearing,"Sound waves enter the ear and vibrate the eardrum, which then moves the ossicles",Cause and Effect
"Sound waves enter the ear and vibrate the eardrum, which then moves the ossicles","The malleus, incus, and stapes transmit these vibrations to the cochlea",Cause and Effect
"The malleus, incus, and stapes transmit these vibrations to the cochlea","Within the cochlea, the vibrations cause the fluid to move, stimulating hair cells",Cause and Effect
"Within the cochlea, the vibrations cause the fluid to move, stimulating hair cells",Hair cells convert this mechanical energy into electrical signals,Cause and Effect
Hair cells convert this mechanical energy into electrical signals,These electrical signals are then transmitted to the brain via the auditory nerve,Cause and Effect
These electrical signals are then transmitted to the brain via the auditory nerve,The brain interprets these signals as sound,Cause and Effect
The brain interprets these signals as sound,"The organization of hair cells in the cochlea, from base to apex, allows for different frequencies to be detected",Cause and Effect
"The organization of hair cells in the cochlea, from base to apex, allows for different frequencies to be detected",This frequency-place theory explains how the cochlea transduces sound,Cause and Effect
This frequency-place theory explains how the cochlea transduces sound,Damage to hair cells can lead to hearing loss,Cause and Effect
Damage to hair cells can lead to hearing loss,The cochlea's role in sound transduction is essential for hearing,Cause and Effect
The cochlea's role in sound transduction is essential for hearing,Understanding these mechanisms helps in diagnosing and treating hearing impairments,Cause and Effect
Understanding these mechanisms helps in diagnosing and treating hearing impairments,The cochlea's structure and function are finely tuned to convert sound waves into neural signals,Cause and Effect
The cochlea's structure and function are finely tuned to convert sound waves into neural signals,Each relationship between sentences is clearly marked to elucidate the logical connections,Cause and Effect
