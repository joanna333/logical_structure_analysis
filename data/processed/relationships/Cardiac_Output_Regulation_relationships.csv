Sentence 1,Sentence 2,Relationship
"Cardiac output is influenced by several factors, including heart rate, stroke volume, and vascular resistance","Heart rate increases during exercise to boost cardiac output, which is a causal relationship",Cause and Effect
"Heart rate increases during exercise to boost cardiac output, which is a causal relationship","Stroke volume, the amount of blood ejected with each heartbeat, also plays a crucial role in regulating cardiac output",Cause and Effect
"Stroke volume, the amount of blood ejected with each heartbeat, also plays a crucial role in regulating cardiac output","Vascular resistance, the opposition to blood flow, decreases during exercise, which further enhances cardiac output",Cause and Effect
"Vascular resistance, the opposition to blood flow, decreases during exercise, which further enhances cardiac output",The body senses the increased demand for oxygen during exercise and adjusts these factors to maintain adequate cardiac output,Cause and Effect
The body senses the increased demand for oxygen during exercise and adjusts these factors to maintain adequate cardiac output,"The autonomic nervous system, specifically the sympathetic nervous system, increases heart rate to elevate cardiac output",Cause and Effect
"The autonomic nervous system, specifically the sympathetic nervous system, increases heart rate to elevate cardiac output","At the same time, hormones like epinephrine and norepinephrine are released, which also increase heart rate and stroke volume",Cause and Effect
"At the same time, hormones like epinephrine and norepinephrine are released, which also increase heart rate and stroke volume","These hormonal changes are a response to the increased demand for blood flow to active muscles, illustrating the body's complex regulation system",Cause and Effect
"These hormonal changes are a response to the increased demand for blood flow to active muscles, illustrating the body's complex regulation system","If heart rate or stroke volume decreases, cardiac output would be compromised, potentially leading to inadequate oxygen delivery to tissues",Cause and Effect
"If heart rate or stroke volume decreases, cardiac output would be compromised, potentially leading to inadequate oxygen delivery to tissues",The body's feedback mechanisms ensure that cardiac output remains within a functional range during exercise,Cause and Effect
The body's feedback mechanisms ensure that cardiac output remains within a functional range during exercise,"In summary, cardiac output is regulated during exercise through the coordinated increase of heart rate, stroke volume, and the reduction of vascular resistance",Cause and Effect
"In summary, cardiac output is regulated during exercise through the coordinated increase of heart rate, stroke volume, and the reduction of vascular resistance",Understanding these factors and their relationships is key to comprehending how the body maintains adequate circulation during physical activity,Cause and Effect
Understanding these factors and their relationships is key to comprehending how the body maintains adequate circulation during physical activity,These mechanisms,Cause and Effect
