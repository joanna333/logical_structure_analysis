"They are initially exposed to self-antigens within the bone marrow, which helps in the selection of B cells that produce antibodies specific only to non-self-antigens","This process is facilitated by various regulatory molecules, such as the Fc receptor for IgM (FcRμ), which binds to IgM antibodies bound to self-antigens and inhibits B cell activation",Explanation
"This process is facilitated by various regulatory molecules, such as the Fc receptor for IgM (FcRμ), which binds to IgM antibodies bound to self-antigens and inhibits B cell activation","Once the immune system is established, several additional mechanisms ensure ongoing immune tolerance",Explanation
"Once the immune system is established, several additional mechanisms ensure ongoing immune tolerance","Analogous to T cell regulation, B cells also express inhibitory receptors that can bind to self-antigens, such as the receptor for IgG (FcγRII/III), which can inhibit B cell activation when bound to IgG antibodies attached to self-antigens",Comparison
"Analogous to T cell regulation, B cells also express inhibitory receptors that can bind to self-antigens, such as the receptor for IgG (FcγRII/III), which can inhibit B cell activation when bound to IgG antibodies attached to self-antigens",Treg cells,Comparison
Treg cells,Regulatory T cells (Treg cells) play a pivotal role in maintaining immune tolerance by suppressing the activation of other immune cells,Explanation
Regulatory T cells (Treg cells) play a pivotal role in maintaining immune tolerance by suppressing the activation of other immune cells,They are crucial for preventing autoimmunity as they can recognize self-antigens and maintain a state of unresponsiveness in other immune cells that might otherwise respond to self-antigens,Explanation
They are crucial for preventing autoimmunity as they can recognize self-antigens and maintain a state of unresponsiveness in other immune cells that might otherwise respond to self-antigens,Clonal deletion,Explanation
Clonal deletion,"This process involves the elimination of B and T cells that are autoreactive, ensuring that those cells that have the potential to cause autoimmunity are removed before they can become active",Explanation
"This process involves the elimination of B and T cells that are autoreactive, ensuring that those cells that have the potential to cause autoimmunity are removed before they can become active",Anergy,Explanation
Anergy,This state of unresponsiveness occurs when T cells encounter self-antigens but cannot effectively activate,Explanation
This state of unresponsiveness occurs when T cells encounter self-antigens but cannot effectively activate,This prevents the initiation of an autoimmune response,Explanation
This prevents the initiation of an autoimmune response,Suppression by cytokines,Explanation
Suppression by cytokines,The cytokine environment can also dictate the level of immune responsiveness,Explanation
The cytokine environment can also dictate the level of immune responsiveness,"Certain cytokines can suppress immune responses to self-antigens, thus maintaining tolerance",Explanation
"Certain cytokines can suppress immune responses to self-antigens, thus maintaining tolerance","The breakdown of immune tolerance can lead to autoimmunity, where the immune system mistakenly attacks and damages healthy tissues",Explanation
