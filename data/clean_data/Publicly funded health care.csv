Publicly funded health care,Publicly funded healthcare is a form of health care financing designed to meet the cost of all or most healthcare needs from a publicly managed fund Usually this is under some form of democratic accountability the right of access to which are set down in rules applying to the whole population contributing to the fund or receiving benefits from it The fund may be a notforprofit trust that pays out for healthcare according to common rules established by the members or by some other democratic form In some countries the fund is controlled directly by the government or by an agency of the government for the benefit of the entire population That distinguishes it from other forms of private medical insurance the rights of access to which are subject to contractual obligations between an insured person or their sponsor and an insurance company which seeks to make a profit by managing the flow of funds between funders and providers of health care services When taxation is the primary means of financing health care and sometimes with compulsory insurance all eligible people receive the same level of cover regardless of their financial circumstances or risk factors  Varieties of public systems  Most developed countries have partially or fully publicly funded health systems Most western industrial countries have a system of social insurance based on the principle of social solidarity that covers eligible people from bearing the direct burden of most health care expenditure funded by taxation during their working life Among countries with significant public funding of healthcare there are many different approaches to the funding and provision of medical services Systems may be funded from general government revenues as in Canada United Kingdom Brazil and India or through a government social security system as in Australia France Belgium Japan and Germany with a separate budget and hypothecated taxes or contributions The proportion of the cost of care covered also differs in Canada all hospital care is paid for by the government while in Japan patients must pay 10 to 30 of the cost of a hospital stay Services provided by public systems vary For example the Belgian government pays the bulk of the fees for dental and eye care while the Australian government covers eye care but not dental care Publicly funded medicine may be administered and provided by the government as in the Nordic countries Portugal Spain and Italy in some systems though medicine is publicly funded but most hospital providers are private entities as in Canada The organization providing public health insurance is not necessarily a public administration and its budget may be isolated from the main state budget Some systems do not provide universal healthcare or restrict coverage to public health facilities Some countries such as Germany have multiple public insurance organizations linked by a common legal framework Some such as the Netherlands and Switzerland allow private forprofit insurers to participate  Twotier healthcare  Almost every major country that has a publicly funded healthcare system also has a parallel private system for patients who hold private medical insurance or themselves pay for treatment In those states those able to pay have access to treatment and comforts that may not be available to those dependent upon the state system From the inception of the NHS model 1948 public hospitals in the United Kingdom have included amenity beds which would typically be siderooms fitted more comfortably and private wards in some hospitals where for a fee more amenities are provided Patients using these beds are in an NHS hospital for surgical treatment and operations are generally carried out in the same operating theatres as NHS work and by the same personnel but the hospital and the physician receive funding from an insurance company or the patient These amenity beds do not exist in all publicly funded systems such as in Spain The NHS also pays for private hospitals to take on surgical cases under contract  Policy discussion  Many countries are seeking the right balance of public and private insurance public subsidies and outofpocket payments Many OECD countries have implemented reforms to achieve policy goals of ensuring access to health care improving the quality of health care and health outcomes allocating an appropriate level of public sector other resources to healthcare but at the same time ensuring that services are provided in a costefficient and costeffective manner microeconomic efficiency A range of measures such as better payment methods have improved the microeconomic incentives facing providers However introducing improved incentives through a more competitive environment among providers and insurers has proved difficult A 2009 Harvard study published in the American Journal of Public Health found more than 44800 excess deaths annually in the United States because of Americans lacking health insurance equivalent to one excess death every 12 min More broadly the total number of people in the United States whether insured or uninsured who die because of lack of medical care was estimated in a 1997 analysis to be nearly 100000 per year
