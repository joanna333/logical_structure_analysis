Urinary anti-infective agent,Urinary antiinfective agent also known as urinary antiseptic is medication that can eliminate microorganisms causing urinary tract infection UTI UTI can be categorized into two primary types cystitis which refers to lower urinary tract or bladder infection and pyelonephritis which indicates upper urinary tract or kidney infection Escherichia coli E Coli is the predominant microbial trigger of UTIs accounting for 75 to 95 of reported cases Other pathogens such as Proteus mirabilis Klebsiella pneumoniae and Staphylococcus saprophyticus can also cause UTIs The use of antimicrobial therapy to treat UTIs started in the 20th century Nitrofurantoin trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole TMPSMX fosfomycin and pivmecillinam are currently the firstline agents for empiric therapy of simple cystitis On the other hand the choice of empiric antimicrobial therapy for pyelonephritis depends on the severity of illness specific host factors and the presence of resistant bacteria Ceftriaxone is often considered for parenteral treatment while oral or parenteral fluoroquinolones such as levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin are suitable alternatives for treating pyelonephritis Antimicrobial therapy should be tailored to the individual considering factors like the severity of illness specific host factors and pathogen resistance in the local community  Types of urinary antiinfective agent  Urinary antiseptics are medications that target bacteria in the urinary tract They can be divided into two groups bactericidal agents and bacteriostatic agents These antiseptics help prevent infections by effectively eliminating UTI symptoms through their action on microorganisms  Urinary bactericidal agents   Nitrofurantoin  Nitrofurantoin is regarded as the firstline agent for simple cystitis with an efficacy rate ranging from 88 to 92 It can also be a prophylactic agent to prevent longterm UTIs This antibacterial medication is effective against both grampositive and gramnegative bacteria Nitrofurantoin exhibits its bactericidal activity through various mechanisms including inhibiting ribosomal translation causing bacterial DNA damage and interfering with the citric acid cycle However the specific role of each mechanism remains to be further explored When nitrofurantoin is metabolized it converts into a reactive intermediate that attacks bacterial ribosomes inhibiting bacterial protein synthesis This medication is typically taken orally and has minimal systemic absorption reducing potential side effects Common adverse reactions associated with nitrofurantoin include brown urine discoloration nausea vomiting loss of appetite rash and peripheral neuropathy  Fosfomycin  Fosfomycin is a phosphonic acid bactericidal agent It is commonly used as the firstline treatment for acute simple cystitis demonstrating a 91 cure rate It is administered orally as a single dose In more complicated UTIs the dose is adjusted to be repeated every three days to achieve successful eradication The bactericidal effect of fosfomycin is attributed to its capability to inhibit bacterial wall synthesis by inactivating an enzyme called pyruvyl transferase which is responsible for microbial cell wall synthesis Fosfomycin acts against grampositive and gramnegative bacteria Administration of fosfomycin may lead to side effects such as headache dizziness nausea vomiting and abdominal cramps  Betalactam antibiotics  Betalactam antibiotics are often considered as a secondline option for treating UTIs due to their lower effectiveness compared to other antibiotics and their potential adverse effects Commonly used betalactam antibiotics for UTIs include cephalosporins and penicillin By binding to penicillinbinding proteins through their betalactam rings betalactam antibiotics disrupt the normal function of these proteins inhibiting bacterial cell wall synthesis ultimately resulting in cell death Cephalosporins are a subclass of betalactam family with broadspectrum activity against grampositive and gramnegative bacteria They are categorized into five generations First and thirdgeneration cephalosporins like cefalexin and ceftriaxone are more commonly used in clinical practice Common adverse effects associated with cephalosporins include hypersensitivity rash anaphylaxis and seizures Penicillin is another widely used subclass that effectively targets various bacteria However it is not regarded as the firstline treatment for uncomplicated cystitis because of the high prevalence of penicillinresistant E coli strains Within the penicillin class pivmecillinam is considered the firstline empiric treatment for acute cystitis due to its wide spectrum of activity against gramnegative bacteria and its specific efficacy in the urinary tract It has consistently demonstrated a high cure rate of over 85 for UTIs and a low resistance rate among E coli strains Amoxicillinclavulanate combination which enhances the effectiveness of amoxicillin is often used as an alternative for cystitis treatment when other options cannot be used  Fluoroquinolones  Fluoroquinolones are a class of antimicrobial agents known for their high efficacy and broad spectrum activity against aerobic grampositive and gramnegative bacteria These potent antibiotics exert their bactericidal effects by selectively inhibiting the activity of type II DNA topoisomerases which effectively halt the replication of bacterial DNA leading to bacterial death Among the fluoroquinolones ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin are used more frequently for the treatment of UTIs These agents are wellabsorbed orally and achieve significant concentrations in urine and various tissues However fluoroquinolones administration carries risk of GI symptoms confusion hypersensitivity tendinopathy and neuropathy Additionally the extensive use of fluoroquinolones has contributed to the prevalence of antimicrobial resistance in some areas As a result fluoroquinolones are generally reserved for more serious UTIs or when there are no better anti urinaryinfective agent options  Bacterial static agent   Sulfonamide  Sulfonamide is a bacteriostatic agent that competitively inhibits the bacterial enzyme dihydropteroate synthase By acting as a substrate analog of paraaminobenzoic acid sulfonamide inhibits folic acid production TMPSMX is a combination of two antibacterial agents that work synergistically to combat a wide range of urinary tract pathogens TMPSMX is commonly used due to its ability to achieve high concentrations in urinary tract tissues and urine This antibiotic combination demonstrates notable efficacy in both the treatment and prophylaxis of recurrent urinary tract infections Common adverse effects include nausea vomiting rashpruritus and photosensitivity  Renal dysfunction  Kidney disease can affect drug elimination absorption and distribution in the body leading to altered serum drug concentrations This can increase the risk of drug toxicity or suboptimal therapeutic effects As a result dosage adjustments are necessary for patients who fail to achieve the desired therapeutic serum drug levels  Management  The choice of urinary antiinfective agents for patients with renal dysfunction is generally similar to that for individuals with normal kidney function However in cases where the patients glomerular filtration rate GFR decreases to less than 20 mLmin drug dosages adjustment is necessary because achieving the desired therapeutic serum drug levels becomes challenging in such patients  Medication safety  Some drugs need to be used with caution in patients with renal dysfunction The use of nitrofurantoin is contraindicated in patients with an estimated GFR of less than 30 mLmin173m2 as drug accumulation can lead to increased side effects and impaired recovery of the urinary tract increasing the risk of treatment failure The use of TMPSMX also raises concerns in patients with kidney disease In patients with creatinine clearance less than 50 mLmin the urine concentrations of SMX may decrease to subtherapeutic levels Therefore in patients with low creatinine clearance it is recommended to prescribe a reduced dosage of TMP alone  Pregnancy  Pregnant women with UTIs are at a higher risk of experiencing recurrent bacteriuria and developing pyelonephritis compared to nonpregnant individuals Untreated UTIs during pregnancy can lead to adverse outcomes including preterm birth and low birth weight infants  Management  Antimicrobial treatment should be adjusted for UTIs in pregnant women to avoid potential side effects brought to fetus For acute cystitis and pyelonephritis in pregnant women empiric antibiotic treatment is often initiated Commonly used antibiotics for uncomplicated cystitis include amoxicillinclavulanate and fosfomycin while parenteral betalactams are preferred for acute pyelonephritis These options are chosen because they are considered safer in pregnancy and have a relatively broad spectrum of activity Typically an antimicrobial course of five to seven days is given This duration is chosen to minimize fetal exposure to antimicrobials while ensuring optimal treatment outcomes  Medication safety  The type of urinary antiinfective agents should be carefully chosen for pregnant women with UTIs due to the potential impact on fetal development Penicillins cephalosporins and fosfomycin are safe options during pregnancy Nitrofurantoin is typically avoided during the first trimester due to uncertain associations with congenital anomalies TMPSMX should also be avoided as it may be associated with impaired folate metabolism which increases the risk of neural tube defects However when all alternative antibiotics are contraindicated nitrofurantoin and TMPSMX become the last resort at the expense of the fetus Fluoroquinolones should be avoided during pregnancy as they are associated with bone and cartilage toxicity in developing fetuses  Pediatrics  Urinary tract infection in pediatric patients is a significant clinical issue affecting approximately 7 of fevered infants and children If left untreated the infection can ascend from the bladder to the kidneys resulting in acute pyelonephritis which leads to hypertension kidney scarring and endstage kidney disease  Management  The choice of urinary antiinfective agents used in pediatric patients and the duration of therapy depend on the types of UTIs they are suffering from It is important to note that the dosage of antibiotics used in children is typically weightdependent Generally oral or parenteral cephalosporins are recommended as the firstline agent for children older than two months Secondline therapy should be considered for patients who have poor response to firstline treatment Alternative choices include amoxicillinclavulanate nitrofurantoin TMPSMX and ciprofloxacin For the treatment of simple cystitis in children a fiveday oral course of cephalexin is the preferred choice As for children with suspected pyelonephritis a tenday treatment regimen is recommended In such cases a thirdgeneration cephalosporin such as cefdinir is suggested as an appropriate option If secondline therapy is initiated in pediatric patients with suspected pyelonephritis ciprofloxacin should be the preferred option among the four alternatives Nitrofurantoin may not be adequate in treating upper urinary tract infections while TMPSMX and amoxicillinclavulanate should be used with caution due to the risk of kidney scarring in these patients  Medication safety  The choice of urinary antiinfective agents in pediatric patients may differ from that in adults due to the potential harm they can cause to children For example the systemic use of fluoroquinolones is not appropriate in pediatric patients due to the potential risk of musculoskeletal toxicity  History  The discovery of antimicrobial agents contributed significantly to UTI management during the 20th century Nitrofurantoin emerged as the first practical and safe urinary antimicrobial agent but it was with limited spectrum of activity Subsequently in the 1970s betalactam antibiotics and TMPSMX became available for UTI therapy Antimicrobial resistance was developed to these agents due to their widespread and extensive usage which restricted their clinical efficacy in UTI management Fluoroquinolones emerged during the 1980s and were recommended as an alternative when resistance to TMPSMX reaches 10 or higher The evolving landscape of drug resistance will continue to influence the development and application of antimicrobial agents in UTI therapy
