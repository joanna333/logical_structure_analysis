Otorhinolaryngologists are physicians MD DO MBBS MBChB etc who complete both medical school and an average of fiveseven years of postgraduate surgical training in ORLHN In the United States trainees complete at least five years of surgical residency training This comprises three to six months of general surgical training and four and a half years in ORLHN specialist surgery In Canada and the United States practitioners complete a fiveyear residency training after medical school Following residency training some otolaryngologisthead  neck surgeons complete an advanced subspecialty fellowship where training can be one to two years in duration Fellowships include head and neck surgical oncology facial plastic surgery rhinology and sinus surgery neurootology pediatric otolaryngology and laryngology In the United States and Canada otorhinolaryngology is one of the most competitive specialties in medicine in which to obtain a residency position following medical school In the United Kingdom entrance to higher surgical training is competitive and involves a rigorous national selection process The training programme consists of 6 years of higher surgical training after which trainees frequently undertake fellowships in a subspeciality prior to becoming a consultant The typical total length of education training and postsecondary school is 1214 years

reconstruction repair  Microvascular reconstruction repair is a common operation that is done on patients who see an otorhinolaryngologist It is a surgical procedure that involves moving a composite piece of tissue from the patients body and to the head andor neck Microvascular headandneck reconstruction is used to treat headandneck cancers including those of the larynx and pharynx oral cavity salivary glands jaws calvarium sinuses tongue and skin The tissue that is most commonly moved during this procedure is from the arms legs and back and can come from the skin bone fat andor muscle When doing this procedure the decision on which is moved is determined on the reconstructive needs Transfer of the tissue to the head and neck allows surgeons to rebuild the patients jaw optimize tongue function and reconstruct the throat When the pieces of tissue are moved they require their own blood supply for a chance of survival in their new location After the surgery is completed the blood vessels that feed the tissue transplant are reconnected to new blood vessels in the neck These blood vessels are typically no more than 1 to 3 millimeters in diameter which means that these connections need to be made with a microscope which is why the procedure is called microvascular surgery
