Environmental medicine,Environmental medicine is a multidisciplinary field involving medicine environmental science chemistry and others overlapping with environmental pathology It can be viewed as the medical branch of the broader field of environmental health The scope of this field involves studying the interactions between environment and human health and the role of the environment in causing or mediating disease This specialist field of study developed after the realisation that health is more widely and dramatically affected by environmental factors than previously recognized Environmental factors in the causation of environmental diseases can be classified into Physical Chemical Biological Social including Psychological and Culture variables Ergonomic Safety Any combination of the above In the United States the American College of Preventive Medicine oversees board certification of physicians in Occupational and Environmental Medicine 1  Current focuses of environmental medicine  While environmental medicine is a broad field some of the currently prominent issues include The effects of ozone depletion and the resulting increase in UV radiation on humans with regards to skin cancer The effects of nuclear accidents or the effects of a terrorist dirty bomb attack and the resulting effects of radioactive material and radiation on humans The effects of chemicals on humans such as dioxin especially with regards to developmental effects and cancer Others include PFOAPFAS Plastic pollution from Microplastics and Nanoplastics Radon gas exposure in individuals homes Air and water pollution on the health of individuals Mercury poisoning and exposure to humans through including fish and sea life in their diet Lead poisoning from leaded gasoline paint and plumbing Waterborne diseases Food poisoning Indoor air quality According to recent estimates about 5 to 10 of disabilityadjusted life years DALY lost are due to environmental causes By far the most important factor is fine particulate matter pollution in urban air  Scope of environmental medicine  Environmental medicine is concerned primarily with prevention Foodborne infections or infections that are waterborne eg cholera and gastroenteritis caused by norovirus or campylobacteria are typical concerns of environmental medicine but some opinions in the fields of microbiology hold that the viruses bacteria and fungi that they study are not within the scope of environmental medicine if the spread of infection is directly from human to human Much of epidemiology which studies patterns of disease and injury is not within the scope of environmental medicine but eg air pollution epidemiology is a highly active branch of environmental health and environmental medicine Any disease with a large genetic component usually falls outside the scope of environmental medicine but in diseases like asthma or allergies both environmental and genetic approaches are needed  Military environmental medicine  The US Army has since at least 1961 used the term environmental medicine in a sense different from the above Its US Army Research Institute of Environmental Medicine at Natick Massachusetts conducts basic and applied research to determine how exposure to extreme heat severe cold high terrestrial altitude military occupational tasks physical training deployment operations and nutritional factors affect the health and performance of military personnel Research on the effect of environmental pollutants on military personnel is not part of USARIEMs mission but is within the purview of the US Army Center for Environmental Health Research at Fort Detrick Maryland
