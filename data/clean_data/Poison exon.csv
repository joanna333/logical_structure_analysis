Poison exon,Poison exons PEs also called premature termination codon PTC exons or nonsensemediated decay NMD exons are a class of cassette exons that contain PTCs Inclusion of a PE in a transcript targets the transcript for degradation via NMD PEs are generally highly conserved elements of the genome and are thought to have important regulatory roles in biology Targeting PE inclusion or exclusion in certain transcripts is being evaluated as a therapeutic strategy  Discovery  In 2002 a model termed regulated unproductive splicing and translation RUST was proposed based on the finding that many onethird alternatively spliced transcripts contain PEs In this model coupling alternative splicing to NMD ASNMD is thought to tune transcript levels to regulate protein expression Alternative splicing may also lead to NMD via other pathways besides PE inclusion eg intron retention PEs were initially characterized in RNAbinding proteins from the SR protein family Genes for other RNAbinding proteins RBPs such as those for heterogenous nuclear ribonucleoprotein hnRNP also contain PEs Numerous chromatin regulators also contain PEs though these are less conserved than PEs within RBPs such as the SR proteins Multiple spliceosomal components contain PEs PEcontaining transcripts generally represent a minority of the overall transcript population in part due to their active degradation via NMD though this relative abundance can be elevated upon inhibition of NMD or certain biological states Certain PEcontaining transcripts are resistant to NMD and may be translated into truncated proteins  Regulation  Cisregulatory elements neighboring PEs have been found to affect PE inclusion Many proteins whose corresponding genes contain PEs autoregulate PE inclusion in their respective transcripts and thereby control their own levels via a feedback loop Crossregulation of PE inclusion has also been observed Differential splicing of PEs is implicated in biological processes such as differentiation neurodevelopment dispersal of nuclear speckles during hypoxia tumorigenesis organism growth and T cell expansion PE inclusion can be regulated by external variables such as temperature and electrical activity For example PE inclusion in RBM3 transcript is lowered during hypothermia This is mediated by temperaturedependent binding of the splicing factor HNRNPH1 to the RBM3 transcript The neuronal RBPs NOVA12 are translocated from the nucleus to the cytoplasm during pilocarpineinduced seizure in mice and it was found that NOVA12 regulates the expression of cryptic PEs The glycosyltransferase OGlcNAc transferase is responsible for installing the OGlcNAc posttranslational modification and contains a PE It has been frequently observed that pharmacological or genetic perturbations that elevate cellular OGlcNAc levels increase PE inclusion in the OGT transcript  Disease  Proper regulation of PE inclusion and exclusion is important for health Genetic mutations can affect inclusion of PEs and cause disease For example loss of CCAR1 leads to PE inclusion in the FANCA transcript resulting in a Fanconi anemia phenotype Dysregulation of components of the splicing machinery can also cause dysregulation of PE inclusion Mutations in the splicing factor SF3B1 have been found to promote PE inclusion in BRD9 reducing BRD9 mRNA and protein levels and leading to melanomagenesis Mutations in U2AF1 promote PE inclusion in EIF4A2 leading to impaired global mRNA translation and acute myeloid leukemia AML chemoresistance through the integrated stress response pathway The splicing factor SRSF6 contains a PE whose skipping is connected to T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia TALL and PE inclusion in SRSF10 is linked to acute lymphoblastic leukemia ALL Intronic mutations can lead to PE inclusion such as in the case of SCN1A where mutations within intron 20 promote inclusion of the nearby PE 20N leading to Dravet syndromelike phenotypes in mouse models An intronic mutation in FLNA has been found to impair binding of the splicing regulator PTBP1 leading to inclusion of a poison exon in FLNA transcripts that causes a brainspecific malformation Differential inclusion of PEs in various splicing factor and hnRNP genes has been reported in type 1 diabetes  Clinical relevance   Diagnostics  With the advent of nextgeneration sequencing technologies diagnostic genetic testing has emerged as a powerful tool to diagnose afflictions associated with specific genetic variants Many diagnostic genetic testing efforts have focused on exome sequencing PE annotations may improve the diagnostic yield of these tests for certain diseases For example variants that affect PE inclusion in sodium channel genes SCN1A SCN2A and SCN8A have been found to be associated with epilepsies and analogous variants in SNRPB have been found to be associated with cerebrocostomandibular syndrome  Therapeutic discovery  As PE inclusion results in transcript degradation targeted PE inclusion or exclusion is being evaluated as a therapeutic strategy This strategy may prove especially applicable towards targets whose gene products are not easily ligandable such as undruggable proteins Targeting PE inclusionexlusion has been demonstrated with both small molecules and antisense oligonucleotides ASOs Small molecules may modulate splicing by stabilizing alternative splice sites ASOs may block specific splice sites or target certain cisregulatory elements to promote splicing at other sites These ASOs may also be referred to as spliceswitching oligonucleotides SSOs ASO walks tiling different ASOs across a gene sequence may be necessary to identify ASOs that have the desired effect on PE inclusion Stoke Therapeutics is evaluating a strategy termed Targeted Augmentation of Nuclear Gene Output TANGO Targeting exon 20N in SCN1A mRNA with the antisense oligonucleotide STK001 blocks inclusion of this PE leading to elevated levels of the productive SCN1A transcript and the gene product sodium channel protein 1 subunit alpha NaV11 In mouse models of Dravet syndrome which is driven by mutations in SCN1A STK001 was able to reduce incidence of electrographic seizures and sudden unexpected death in epilepsy and prolong survival As of October 2024 STK001 is being evaluated in phase 2 clinical trials NCT04740476 Stoke Therapeutics is also evaluating the ASO STK002 for treatment of autosomal dominant optic atrophy ADOA STK002 promotes removal of a PE in the transcript of OPA1 leading to elevated OPA1 protein levels Remix Therapeutics developed REM422 which is an oral small molecule that promotes PE inclusion in the oncogene MYB REM422 was discovered through a screening campaign for molecules that promote PE inclusion in MYB Subsequent in vitro experiments showed that REM422 selectively facilitates binding of the U1 snRNP complex to oligonucleotides containing the MYB 5 splice site sequence In various AML cell lines REM422 leads to degradation of MYB mRNA and lower MYB protein levels REM422 demonstrated antitumor activity in mouse xenograft models of acute myeloid leukemia As of October 2024 REM422 is being evaluated in phase 1 clinical trials NCT06118086 NCT06297941 The splicing modulator small molecule risdiplam originally developed to promote exon 7 inclusion in the SMN2 transcript for treatment of spinal muscular atrophy dosedependently promotes PE inclusion in the MYB transcript as well PTC Therapeutics is evaluating the oral small molecule PTC518 as a treatment for Huntingtons disease PTC518 was welltolerated and showed dosedependent decreases in HTT mRNA and HTT protein levels in a phase 1 clinical trial As of October 2024 PTC518 is being evaluated in phase 2 clinical trials NCT05358717 Therapeutic targeting of poison exon inclusionexclusion has also been proposed for oncogenic splicing factors BRD9 for treatment of cancer SYNGAP1 RBM3 for treatment of neurodegeneration and CFTR for treatment of cystic fibrosis
