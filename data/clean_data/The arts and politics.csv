The arts and politics,A strong relationship between the arts and politics particularly between various kinds of art and power occurs across historical epochs and cultures As they respond to contemporaneous events and politics the arts take on political as well as social dimensions becoming themselves a focus of controversy and even a force of political as well as social change A widespread observation is that a great talent has a free spirit For instance Pushkin who some scholars regard as Russias first great writer attracted the mad irritation of the Russian officialdom and particularly of the Tsar since he instead of being a good servant of the state in the rank and file of the administration and extolling conventional virtues in his vocational writings if write he must composed extremely arrogant and extremely independent and extremely wicked verse in which a dangerous freedom of thought was evident in the novelty of his versification in the audacity of his sensual fancy and in his propensity for making fun of major and minor tyrants Art and politics continue to have a strong relationship today Artists continue to use their work to express their political views and to promote social change And governments continue to use art to promote their own agendas  History of art  According to Groys Art has its own power in the world and is as much a force in the power play of global politics today as it once was in the arena of cold war politics  Social and political change  Pertaining to such politicallyintractable phenomena as the Modern conflicts in the Middle East however some artists and social critics believe that art is useless as a tool for political change There are nevertheless examples where artists employ art in the service of political change  Role of poetry  Poets are the unacknowledged legislators of the world The Italian poet Ungaretti when interviewed on transgression by director Pasolini for the 1964 Love Meetings documentary said that the foundation of poetry is to transgress all laws The recitation of powerful pithy poetry is a popular art form at American protests and political rallies From the civil rights womens liberation gay rights and Puerto Rican Independence movements to Black Lives Matter poetry is used to build emotional unity in crowds and draw media attention Giannina Braschi wrote Poets and anarchists are always the first to go Where To the frontline Wherever it is Protest poems include Gwendolyn Brooks Riot Allen Ginsbergs Howl Tato Lavieras Lady Liberty Nikki Giovannis Rosa Parks Amiri Barakas Short Speech to My Friends and Jill McDonoughs Dear Gaybashers Beat poet Allen Ginsberg was arrested at an antiwar demonstration in New York City in 1967 and teargassed at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago in 1968  Examples   Situationist International  The Situationist International SI a small group of international political and artistic agitators with roots in Marxism Lettrism and the early 20thcentury European artistic and political avantgardes formed in 1957 aspired to major social and political transformations before disbanding in 1972 and splitting into a number of different groups including the Situationist Bauhaus the Antinational and the Second Situationist International the first SI became active in Europe through the 1960s and elsewhere throughout the world and was characterized by an anticapitalist and surrealist perspective on aesthetics and politics according to Italian art historian Francesco Poli In the works of the situationists Italian scholar Mirella Bandini observes there is no separation between art and politics the two confront each other in revolutionary terms Historically revolutionary ideas have emerged first among artists and intellectuals Thats why a precise mechanism to defuse the role of artists and intellectuals is to relegate them into specialized compartmentalized disciplines in order to impose unnatural dichotomies as the separation of art from politics Once artisticintellectual works are separated from current events and from a comprehensive critique of society they are sterilized and can be safely integrated into the official culture and the public discourse where they can add new flavours to old dominant ideas and play the role of a gear wheel in the mechanism of the society of the spectacle  Poster art  Not content with claiming leftwing music posters for the Conservative Party in the UK recycled iconic art styles of socialist revolution to communicate its political message in 2008 In the 2008 US presidential election Shepard Faireys Barack Obama Hope poster became almost instantly iconic and inseparable from Obama and his campaign Almost immediately after its creation the artwork went viral spreading throughout social media and through word of mouth largely due to the publicity efforts of Yosi Sergant Throughout history Communist governments have used poster art as a common form of propaganda used to promote the ideology of communism namely the Soviet Union in the early 20th Century The Great Soviet Encyclopedia defines communist propaganda as being the expression of the essential worldview of the working class and its natural aims and interests defined by its historical position as the social force which will ultimately usher in the epoch of communism  Entropa  Czech sculptor David Černýs Entropa a sculpture commissioned to mark the Czech presidency of the European Union Council during the first semester of 2009 illustrates how art can come into conflict with politics creating various kinds of controversy in the process both intentionally and unintentionally Entropa attracted controversy both for its stereotyped depictions of the various EU member states and for having been a creation of Černý and two friends rather than as Černý purported a collaboration of 27 artists from each of the member states Some European Union members states reacted negatively to the depiction of their country with Bulgaria for instance deciding to summon the Czech Ambassador to Sofia in order to discuss the illustration of the Balkan country as a collection of squat toilets ČTK This Europewide hoax  reveals deeper truths not only about the countries but about art itself Gavrilova  Russian aesthetics  After the Russian Revolution Soviet Art came under strict ideological control According to Esti Sheinberg a lecturer in music at the University of Edinburgh in her book about Russian composer Dmitri Shostakovich Irony Satire Parody and the Grotesque in the Music of Shostakovich in the traditional Russian perception of the arts an interrelationship between artistic technique and ideological content is the main aesthetic criterion ix cf Blois  Classical music  Ludwig van Beethoven did not use the original title Ode to Freedom of Friedrich Schillers lyric known in English as Ode to Joy 1785 in setting it to music in the final movement of his Ninth Symphony 1824 which Napoleonic censors had forced the poet to change to Ode to Joy After the fall of the Berlin Wall on 9 November 1989 that Christmas Day when Leonard Bernstein conducted a performance of Beethovens Ninth at the site of the former East GermanWest German border in Berlin a concert telecast nationally in the United States he substituted Freedom for Joy to reflect his own personal message  Folk and protest music  In February 1952 the United States Customs Service seized the passport of Paul Robeson preventing him from leaving the United States to travel to the Fourth Canadian Convention of the International Union of Mine Mill and Smelter Workers in Vancouver British Columbia Canada but after The convention heard Robeson sing over the telephone the union organized a concert on the USCanada border According to the account of the Paul Robeson Centennial Celebration Robeson sang and spoke for 45 minutes He introduced his first song stating I stand here today under great stress because I dare as do youall of you to fight for peace and for a decent life for all men women and children  and accompanied by Lawrence Brown on piano proceeded to sing spirituals folk songs labour songs and a passionate version of Old Man River written for him in the 1920s slowly enunciating show a little grit and you land in jail underlining the fact that his government had turned the entire country into a prison for Robeson and many others In the 1960s the songs of Pete Seeger Joan Baez Bob Dylan and others protested further racism war and the militaryindustrial complex continuing an American artistic tradition of political protest founded during its colonial era  Restrictions on livemusic venues   In the United States  In force from July 1985 until May 2002 and considered by its opponents a Draconian antimusic law the Teen Dance Ordinance TDO imposing restrictions on clubs admitting those under the legal drinking age of 21 in Seattle Washington was still the subject of protracted political and legal opposition in US Federal Court in early 2002 when a suit filed by the Joint Artists and Music Promotions Action Committee JAMPAC in 2000 was still being adjudicated In May 2002 Judge Lasnik ruled for the City of Seattle on JAMPACs suit finding no Constitutional infringement of the First Amendment and deciding that the matter is a political one for the Seattle City Council to decide not the courts during the course of the suit Mayor Schells successor Greg Nickels a proponent of the bill resubmitted the ordinance to the Seattle City Council and on 12 August 2002 the new AllAges Dance Ordinance AADO replaced the TDO but was not considered much of an improvement by its critics In May 2008 a Promoters Ordinance proposed by the Chicago City Council aroused opposition in Chicago Illinois for being regarded as overly restrictive and stifling free expression  In the United Kingdom  Following the implementation of the Licensing Act 2003 the London Borough of Hillingdon cited the interest of public order and the prevention of terrorism as reasons for expecting promoters of live music events to complete the Metropolitan Polices Form 696 Though later clarified by a police spokesperson as not compulsory the perceived demand for the information solicited on such risk assessment forms motivated Jon McClure lead singer with Reverend and The Makers to post an electronic petition in the EPetitions section of the official website of Gordon Brown the UK Prime Minister at Number10govuk in order to facilitate protest against what McClure alleges is racial discrimination occasioned by such bureaucratic constraints which some have deemed police authoritarianism It begins We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to Scrap the unnecessary and draconian usage of the 696 Form from London music events By 11 November 2008 according to Orlowski A dozen London boroughs had implemented a risk assessment Form 696 policy for live music that permits the police to ban any live music if they fail to receive personal details from the performers 14 days in advance Orlowski points out The demand explicitly singles out performances and musical styles favoured by the black community garage and RB and MCs and DJs  However all musical performances  from one man playing a guitar on up  are subject to the demands once implemented by the council And the threat is serious failure to comply may jeopardise future events by the promoter or the venue  UK Music chief Feargal Sharkey  speaking to the Department of Culture Media and Sports hearing on venue licensing today 11 Nov 2008 concluded that  Live music is now a threat to the prevention of terrorism  In response Detective Superintendent Dave Eyles from the Mets clubs and vice office told us that 10000 such Risk Assessments would be processed this year He said they werent compulsory  We cant demand it  we recommend that you provide it as best practice But youre bloody silly if you dont because youre putting your venue at risk By early March 2009 over 16000 British citizens or residents had signed McClures EPetition which remained open to potential signatories until 1 December 2009
