Terminologia Anatomica,Terminologia Anatomica commonly abbreviated TA is the international standard for human anatomical terminology It is developed by the Federative International Programme on Anatomical Terminology a program of the International Federation of Associations of Anatomists IFAA  History  The sixth edition of the previous standard Nomina Anatomica was released in 1989 The first edition of Terminologia Anatomica superseding Nomina Anatomica was developed by the Federative Committee on Anatomical Terminology FCAT and the International Federation of Associations of Anatomists IFAA and released in 1998 In April 2011 this edition was published online by the Federative International Programme on Anatomical Terminologies FIPAT the successor of FCAT The first edition contained 7635 Latin items The second edition was released online by FIPAT in 2019 and approved and adopted by the IFAA General Assembly in 2020 The latest errata is dated August 2021 It contains a total of 7112 numbered terms 17113 skipping 2590 with some terms repeated  Adoption and reception  A 2014 survey of the American Association of Clinical Anatomists found that the TA preferred term had the highest frequency of usage in only 53 of the 25 anatomical terms surveyed and was highest or secondhighest for 92 of terms 75 of respondents were unfamiliar with FIPAT and TA In a panel at the 2022 International Federation of Associations of Anatomists Congress one author stated the Terminologia Anatomica generally receives no attention in medical terminology courses but stressed its importance The TA is not well established in other languages such as French The English equivalent names are often inconsistent if viewed as translations of the accompanying Latin phrases The Terminologia Anatomica specifically excludes eponyms as they were determined to give absolutely no anatomical information about the named structure and vary considerably between countries and cultures In a 2023 study of eight gynecologic eponyms the TA term was preferred in two cases and showed a significant trend towards TA adoption in three others leaving three nonTA terms likely to remain in common use  Categories of anatomical structures  Terminologia Anatomica is divided into 16 chapters grouped into five parts The official terms are in Latin Although equivalent Englishlanguage terms are provided only the official Latin terms are used as the basis for creating lists of equivalent terms in other languages  Part I   Chapter 1 General anatomy  General terms Reference planes Reference lines Human body positions Movements Parts of human body Regions of human body  Part II Musculoskeletal systems   Chapter 2 Bones  Axial skeleton Appendicular skeleton Bones Cranium Extracranial bones of head Auditory ossicles Teeth Nasal cartilages Cartilages of ear Laryngeal cartilages Vertebral column Thoracic skeleton Bones of upper limb Bony pelvis Bones of lower limb Joints  Chapter 3 Joints  Joints of skull Joints of auditory ossicles Laryngeal joints Joints of vertebral column Thoracic joints Joints of upper limb Joints of lower limb  Chapter 4 Muscular system  Cranial part of muscular system Cervical part of muscular system Dorsal part of muscular system Thoracic part of muscular system Abdominal part of muscular system Pelvic part of muscular system Muscular system of upper limb Muscular system of lower limb  Part III Visceral systems   Chapter 5 Digestive system  Mouth Fauces Pharynx Digestive canal Liver Gallbladder Extrahepatic bile ducts Pancreas  Chapter 6 Respiratory system  Nose Paranasal sinuses Larynx Tracheobronchial tree Lungs  Chapter 7 Thoracic cavity  Pleural cavity Mediastinum  Chapter 8 Urinary system  Kidney Ureter Urinary bladder Urethra  Chapter 9 Genital systems  Female genital system Male genital system  Chapter 10 Abdominopelvic cavity   Part IV Integrating systems I   Chapter 11 Endocrine glands  Hypophysis Pineal gland Thyroid gland Parathyroid glands Suprarenal gland Paraganglia  Chapter 12 Cardiovascular system  Blood Lymph Vessels Vascular plexuses Heart Pulmonary vessels Cardiac vessels Systemic arteries Systemic veins Great lymphatic vessels  Chapter 13 Lymphoid organs  Primary lymphoid organs Secondary lymphoid organs  Part V Integrating systems II   Chapter 14 Nervous system  Central nervous system Peripheral nervous system Autonomic division of peripheral nervous system  Chapter 15 Sense organs  Olfactory organ Eye Ear Gustatory organ  Chapter 16 The integument  Skin Skin appendages Subcutaneous tissue Breast Scalp Blood
