Social studies,In many countries curricula social studies is the combined study of humanities the arts and social sciences mainly including history economics and civics The term was first coined by American educators around the turn of the twentieth century as a catchall for these subjects as well as others which did not fit into the models of lower education in the United States such as philosophy and psychology One of the purposes of social studies particularly at the level of higher education is to integrate several disciplines with their unique methodologies and special focuses of concentration into a coherent field of subject areas that communicate with each other by sharing different academic tools and perspectives for deeper analysis of social problems and issues Social studies aims to train students for informed responsible participation in a diverse democratic society The content of social studies provides the necessary background knowledge in order to develop values and reasoned opinions and the objective of the field is civic competence A related term is humanities arts and social sciences abbreviated HASS  In Australia  Human Society and Its Environment HSIE is a similar term used in the education system of the Australian state of New South Wales  In the United Kingdom  The original onset of the social studies field emerged in the 19th century and later grew in the 20th century Those foundations and building blocks were put into place in the 1820s in the country of Great Britain before being integrated into the United States  In the United States  The purpose of the subject itself was to promote social welfare and its development in countries like the United States and others An early concept of social studies is found in John Deweys philosophy of elementary and secondary education Dewey valued the subject field of geography for uniting the study of human occupations with the study of the earth He valued inquiry as a process of learning as opposed to the absorption and recitation of facts and he advocated for greater inquiry in elementary and secondary education to mirror the kind of learning that takes place in higher education His ideas are manifested to a large degree in the practice of inquirybased learning and studentdirected investigations implemented in contemporary social studies classrooms Dewey valued the study of history for its social processes and application to contemporary social problems rather than a mere narrative of human events In this view the study of history is made relevant to the modern student and is aimed at the improvement of society In the United States through the 1900s social studies revolved around the study of geography government and history In 1912 the Bureau of Education not to be confused with its successor agency the United States Department of Education was tasked by then Secretary of the Interior Franklin Knight Lane with completely restructuring the American education system for the twentieth century In response the Bureau of Education together with the National Education Association created the Commission on the Reorganization of Secondary Education The commission was made up of 16 committees a 17th was established two years later in 1916 each one tasked with the reform of a specific aspect of the American Education system Notable among these was the Committee on Social Studies which was created to consolidate and standardize various subjects that did not fit within normal school curricula into a new subject to be called the social studies In 1920 the work done by the Committee on Social Studies culminated in the publication and release of Bulletin No 28 also called The Committee on Social Studies Report 1916 The 66page bulletin published and distributed by the Bureau of Education is believed to be the first written work dedicated entirely to the subject It was designed to introduce the concept to American educators and serve as a guide for the creation of nationwide curricula based around social studies The bulletin proposed many ideas that were considered radical at the time and it is regarded by many educators as one of the most controversial educational resources of the early twentieth century Early proponents of the field of social studies include Harold O Rugg and David Saville Muzzey In the years after its release the bulletin received criticism from educators on its vagueness especially in regards to the definition of Social Studies itself Critics often point to Section 1 of the report which vaguely defines Social Studies as understood to be those whose subject matter relates directly to the organization and development of human society and to man as a member of social groups The changes to the field of study never fully materialized until the 1950s when changes occurred at the state and national levels that dictated the curriculum and the preparation standards of its teacher This led to a decrease in the amount of factual knowledge being delivered instead of focusing on key concepts generalizations and intellectual skills Eventually around the 1980s and 1990s the development of computer technologies helped grow the publishing industry Textbooks were created around the curriculum of each state and that coupled with the increase in political factors from globalization and growing economies lead to changes in the public and private education system Now came the influx of national curriculum standards from the increase of testing to the accountability of teachers and school districts shifting the social study education system to what it is today  Branches of social studies  Social studies is not a subject unto itself instead functioning as a field of study that incorporates many different subjects It primarily includes the subjects of history economics and civics Through all of that the elements of geography sociology ethics psychology philosophy anthropology art and literature are incorporated into the subject field itself The field of study itself focuses on human beings and their respective relationships With that many of these subjects include some form of social utility that is beneficial to the subject field itself The whole field is rarely taught typically a few subjects combined are taught Recognition of the field has arguably lessened the significance of history with the exception of US History Initially only History and Civics were significant parts of the high school curriculum eventually Economics became a significant part of the high school curriculum as well While History and Civics were already established the significance of Economics in the high school curriculum is more recent History and Civics are similar in many ways though they differ in class activity There was some division between scholars on the topic of merging the subjects though it was agreed that presenting a full picture of the world to students was extremely important  College level  Social studies as a college major or concentration remains uncommon although such a degree is offered at Harvard University Harvard first introduced social studies as a formal field of study in 1960 through the work of a committee led by Stanley Hoffman and today known as the Committee on Degrees in Social Studies Hedge fund manager Bill Ackman guitarist Tom Morello and theater director Diana Paulus all concentrated in social studies during their time at Harvard  Teaching social studies  To teach social studies in the United States one must obtain a valid teaching certification to teach in that given state and a valid subject specific certification in social studies The social studies certification process focuses on the core areas of history economics and civics and sometimes psychology and sociology Each state has specific requirements for the certification process and the teacher must follow the specific guidelines of the state they wish to teach  Ten themes of social studies  According to the National Council for the Social Studies there are ten themes that represent the standards about human experience that is constituted in the effectiveness of social studies as a subject study from preK through 12th grade  Culture  The study of culture and diversity allows learners to experience culture through all stages from learning to adaptation shaping their respective lives and society itself This social studies theme includes the principles of multiculturalism a field of study in its own right that aims to achieve greater understanding between culturally diverse groups of students as well as including the experiences of culturally diverse learners in the curriculum  Time continuity and change  Learners examine the past and the history of events that lead to the development of the current world Ultimately the learners will examine the beliefs and values of the past to apply them to the present Learners build their inquiry skills in the study of history  People places and environment  Learners will understand who they are and the environment and places that surround them It gives spatial views and perspectives of the world to the learner This theme is largely contained in the field of geography which includes the study of humanitys connections with resources instruction in reading maps and techniques and perspectives in analyzing information about human populations and the Earths systems  Individual development and identity  Learners will understand their own personal identity development and actions Through this they will be able to understand the influences that surround them  Individuals groups and institutions  Learners will understand how groups and institutions influence peoples everyday lives They will be able to understand how groups and institutions are formed maintained and changed  Power authority and governance  Learners will understand the forms of power authority and governance from historical to contemporary times They will become familiar with the purpose of power and with the limits that power has on society  Production distribution and consumption  Learners will understand the organization of goods and services ultimately preparing the learner for the study of greater economic issues The study of economic issues and with it financial literacy is intended to increase students knowledge and skills when it comes to participating in the economy as workers producers and consumers  Science technology and society  Learners will understand the relationship between science technology and society understanding the advancement through the years and the impacts they have had  Global connections  Learners will understand the interactive environment of global interdependence and will understand the global connections that shape the everyday world  Civic ideals and practices  Learners will understand the rights and responsibilities of citizens and learn to grow in their appreciation of active citizenship Ultimately this helps their growth as full participants in society Some of the values that civics courses strive to teach are an understanding of the right to privacy an appreciation for diversity in American society and a disposition to work through democratic procedures One of the curricular tools used in the field of civics education is a simulated congressional hearing Social studies educators and scholars distinguish between different levels of civic engagement from the minimal engagement or nonengagement of the legal citizen to the most active and responsible level of the transformative citizen Within social studies the field of civics aims to educate and develop learners into transformative citizens who not only participate in a democracy but challenge the status quo in the interest of social justice
