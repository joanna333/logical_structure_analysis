Vicarious mediation and vicarious functioning,Vicarious mediation is the potential level of substitutability in the task itself the different potential ways or mediational pathways that exist for achieving an outcome or performing a task successfully For example what is the substitutability of potential cues for accurate judgments about the size of objects in a visual field particularly when all the cues are not available or are not perfect predictors of size Similarly what is the substitutability of potential behaviors or means to accomplish ones goals or ends when all actions may not be available or equally effective The focus is on the task the various potentially substitutable pathways mediating success in the task itself  Background  Expert judgment as well as everyday judgments require people to use known information to make a judgment about some unknown quantity or event In judgment and decision research the known information makes up the cues and the unknown quantity or event is called the criterion In natural situations the cues are generally related to each other and are only probabilistically related to the criterion As a result of interrelations among the cues there is some degree of intersubstitutability among them that is one cue or set of cues can often be used in place of another This property of intersubstitutability can be helpful in making judgments when as is often the case not all the cues that the person would want are actually available Anderson et al note that The mutual substitutability of cues is what system theorists eg Karl Ludwig von Bertalanffy have called equipotentiality  The mutual substitutability of responses  have been called equifinality p 248 Anderson et al also point out that vicarious mediation is related to redundancy engineering For example in human factors engineering eg Lee et al redundancy gain is defined as presenting the same information through multiple channels to avoid confusion and ensure the information gets through such as traffic lights using both color and position to convey go caution and stop  Vicarious functioning  In contrast vicarious functioning refers to substitutability regarding what people do that is the way they actually function For example vicarious functioning refers to which potentially substitutable cues are actually used and how are they used when people make judgments particularly when all the cues are not available and are not perfect predictors of the criterion What actions do people actually take to accomplish their goals particularly when all actions are not available or equally effective The focus is on the person the various substitutable pathways they actually follow in an effort to function effectively Egon Brunswik noted that Hunter first introduced the term vicarious functioning that vicarious functioning played a major role in the definition of purposeful behavior by William McDougall and Edward C Tolman that Clark L Hull incorporated the concept into his theory of habitfamilyhierarchy and that psychoanalytic mechanisms were an expression of vicarious functioning eg see Else FrenkelBrunswik  Importance of vicarious mediation and vicarious functioning in understanding achievement  Both concepts vicarious mediation substitutability in the task and vicarious functioning substitutability by the person are critical to Brunswiks theory of probabilistic functionalism regarding how people can and in fact do function effectively or not in an uncertain or probabilistic world Gigerenzer and Kurz note Vicarious functioning describes adaptive cognitive processes that can handle two constraints the presence of uncertainty and the need for substitution A cue eg the retinal image of an object is only an uncertain indicator of a distal stimulus eg the distance to the object and a cue may not always be present thus an adaptive system has to rely on multiple cues that can be substituted for each other pp 342343 To quote Kenneth R Hammond the organism meets the vicarious mediation of the environment with vicarious functioning on its own part p 41 Both concepts vicarious mediation in the task and vicarious functioning by the person are essential to understanding achievement The concept of Ecological Rationality developed by Gerd Gigerenzer and his colleagues also extends Brunswiks theory of probabilistic functionalism and the concepts of vicarious mediation and functioning Its focus has been on understanding the simple judgment heuristics people use to combine cue information in different types of task environments When vicarious mediation is high there are many potential substitutable pathways to success The task itself provides different ways or means for people to succeed Consequently people can take different approaches to performing the task and still be successful To take an extreme case if two cues are perfectly correlated then they will have equal ecological validity and therefore be fully redundant in predicting the outcome or distal variable criterion of interest Assuming the cues have high ecological or predictive validities a person need only use one of these two perfectly substitutable cues to predict successfully and different people will be equally successful using different cues However when vicarious mediation is low there are few if any substitutable pathways to success Consequently people must select as many valid pathways as they can to function effectively To quote Brunswik Proper cognitive adjustment demands a that vicarious utilization of many cues be present when validities are imperfect and b that hierarchy of utilization relative strength in rivalry follow the hierarchy of validity p 308 Failure to select the multiple cues with the highest ecological validities will lead to lower achievement because the task itself has less flexibility and robustness when vicarious mediation is low There are many examples of vicarious mediation and vicarious functioning As one example Brunswik showed that size constancythe stable and successful prediction of object size vicarious functioningwas possible because of the substitutability of redundant perceptual cues in the task vicarious mediation In another example Hammond noted that When pigeons are unable to locate the sun because of cloud cover magnetic lines of force function vicariously for the sun to permit successful navigation p 115 Gigerenzer and Kurtz showed that a simple judgment heuristic called Take the Best using only the single best predicting cue could be substituted for far more complex strategies and still maintain or even improve achievement under certain task conditions And Adelman et al showed that under high vicarious mediation teams can interact differently vicarious functioning under increasing time pressure and still maintain comparable achievement In putting forward the concepts of vicarious mediation and vicarious functioning Brunswik highlighted the importance from both a theoretical and methodological perspective of studying the task as well as the person to understand achievement Regarding the former Brunswik developed the lens model to represent his theory of probabilistic functionalism pictorially The left side of the lens model represented vicarious mediation the pathways in the task The right side represented vicarious functioning what the person does to perform the task Achievement was represented by an overarching arrow linking the two sides task and person Hursch et al and Tucker subsequently developed the lens model equation to represent Brunswiks lens model mathematically The message was clear one could not fully understand the effectiveness of individuals functional processes without understanding task characteristics From a methodological perspective Brunswik advocated naturalistic research and the representative design of experiments to study achievement To quote Brunswik  the study of functional personenvironment relationships would seem to require that not only mediation but also focal events and other situational circumstances should be made to represent  the general or specific conditions under which the organism studied has to functionpp 2930 And to quote Hammond  if we are to understand fully how organisms capable of vicarious functioning behave we shall have to place them in situations that permit vicarious functioning to occur p 50 Both theory and method are critical to understanding the role of vicarious mediation and vicarious functioning in achievement
