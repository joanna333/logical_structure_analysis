Rural health,In medicine rural health or rural medicine is the interdisciplinary study of health and health care delivery in rural environments The concept of rural health incorporates many fields including wilderness medicine geography midwifery nursing sociology economics and telehealth or telemedicine Rural populations often experience health disparities and greater barriers in access to healthcare compared to urban populations Globally rural populations face increased burdens of noncommunicable diseases such as cardiovascular disease cancer diabetes and chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder contributing to worse health outcomes and higher mortality rates Factors contributing to these health disparities include remote geography increased rates of health risk behaviors lower population density decreased health insurance coverage among the population lack of health infrastructure and work force demographics People living in rural areas also tend to have less education lower socioeconomic status and higher rates of alcohol and smoking when compared to their urban counterparts Additionally the rate of poverty is higher in rural populations globally contributing to health disparities due to an inability to access healthy foods healthcare and housing Many countries have made it a priority to increase funding for research on rural health These research efforts are designed to help identify the healthcare needs of rural communities and provide policy solutions to ensure those needs are met  Definitions  There is no international standard for defining rural areas and standards may vary even within an individual country The most commonly used methodologies fall into two main camps populationbased factors and geographybased factors The methodologies used for identifying rural areas include population size population density distance from an urban centre settlement patterns labor market influences and postal codes The reported number of individuals living in rural areas can vary greatly depending on which set of standards is applied Canadas rural population can be identified as anywhere from 22 to 38 of the population In the United States the variation is greater between 17 and 63 of the population may be identified as living in rural areas The lack of consensus makes it difficult to identify the number of individuals who are in need of rural healthcare services  Life expectancy and mortality  Rural areas within the US have been found to have a lower life expectancy than urban areas by approximately 24 years Rural US populations are at a greater risk of mortality due to noncommunicable diseases such as heart disease cancer chronic lower respiratory disease and stroke as well as unintentional injuries such as automobile accidents and opioid overdoses compared to urban populations In 1999 the ageadjusted death rate was 7 higher in rural areas compared to urban areas However by 2019 this difference had widened with rural areas experiencing a 20 higher death rate compared to in urban areas There is some evidence to suggest that the gap may be widening as more public health resources are directed away from rural areas towards densely populated urban areas These trends are also observed on a global scale as rural communities are more likely to have lower life expectancies than urban counterparts Data collected from 174 countries found the maternal mortality rate to be 25 times higher in rural areas compared to urban areas Additionally the likelihood that a child born in a rural area will die before the age of 5 is 17 times higher than a child born in an urban area Factors contributing to the increased risk of maternal and child mortality include healthcare worker shortages as well as a lack of health facilities and resources in rural areas  Health determinants   Access to healthcare  People in rural areas generally have less access to healthcare than their urban counterparts Fewer medical practitioners mental health programs and healthcare facilities in these areas often mean less preventative care and longer response times in emergencies Geographic isolation also creates longer travel times to healthcare facilities acting as a barrier to accessing care in rural communities The lack of resources in rural areas have resulted in utilization of telehealth services to improve access to speciality care as well as mobile preventative care and treatment programs Teleheath services have the potential to greatly improve access to providers in remote areas however barriers such as lack of stable internet access create disparities to accessing this care There have also been increased efforts to attract health professionals to isolated locations such as increasing the number of medical students from rural areas and improving financial incentives for rural practices Rural communities face healthcare worker shortages that are more than twice as high as urban communities For example Canadians living in rural areas have access to half as many physicians 1 per 1000 residents and have to travel five times the distance to access these services compared to urban counterparts There is also a lack of specialist physicians such as dermatologists or oncologists in rural communities resulting in a higher reliance on primary care physicians and emergency rooms for healthcare Rural areas especially in Africa have greater difficulties in recruiting and retaining qualified and skilled professionals in the healthcare field In recent years over 30 physicians from subSaharan Africa have left lowincome rural areas and moved to higherincome countries due to burnout This creates further physician shortages and a higher risk of burnout on the physicians that remain in rural communities In subSaharan African countries such as Zambia and Malawi urban areas have disproportionately more of the countries skilled physicians nurses and midwives despite a majority of the population living in rural areas In South Africa alone 43 of the population lives in rural areas but only 12 of doctors actually practice there This is similar to the realities in Ghana which implemented the Communitybased Health Planning and Services CHPS program designed to promote community health through preventive and primary care though the initiative has faced issues due to the uneven distribution of healthcare professionals across all communities The gap in services is due in part to the focus of funding on higherpopulation areas Only 20 of the Chinese governments public health spending went to the rural health system in the 1990s which served 70 of the Chinese population In the United States between 1990 and 2000 228 rural hospitals closed leading to a reduction of 8228 hospital beds In order to improve health care availability in rural areas it is important to understand the needs of each community Each area has unique barriers to accessing care Local officials partners and community members all have a valuable perspective to addressing these issues  Economic Stability and Employment Status  The median income of rural households is typically lower than urban households In 2021 the US Census Bureau reported the median rural household income to be approximately 17000 lower than urban households Additionally there are higher rates of poverty in rural areas compared to urban areas impacting the ability for rural residents to pay for healthcare services and basic living needs One contributing factor is that rural areas have less availability of jobs that pay a living wage and offer health benefits Industries such as mining logging and farming are prevalent in rural areas which are associated with special health problem of their own These professions are associated with health complications due to injuries exposure to toxic chemicals and exposure to diseases from animal waste These industries also impact the environmental health in the surrounding community by contaminating their air and water with toxins  Health Behaviors  Rural residents are more likely to exhibit health risk behaviors than urban residents There are higher rates of smoking and exposure to second hand smoke and lower reports of seatbelt use in rural areas compared to urban Additionally the rural residents report less leisuretime physical activity and higher caloric consumption likely contributing to the increased rates of obesity in rural areas Factors contributing to these behaviors include lack of exercise facilities lack of nutrition specialists at healthcare facilities lack of access to affordable healthy foods and lack of health education Efforts to encourage the adoption of positive health behaviors in rural areas could help to promote better health outcomes and reduce mortality rates  Physical environment  In many countries a lack of critical infrastructure and development in rural areas can impair rural health The physical isolation of some rural communities coupled with the lack of infrastructure makes it increasingly difficult for those that live in these regions to travel to seek care in clinics and hospitals Insufficient wastewater treatment lack of paved roads and exposure to agricultural chemicals have been identified as additional environmental concerns for those living in rural locations The Australian Institute of Health and Welfare reports lower water quality and increased crowding of households as factors affecting disease control in rural and remote locations In hot climates some scholars are exploring how hybrid solar energy systems could to provide power to different kinds of healthcare equipment The solar energy solution would dramatically reduce costs in tropical climate countries such as the Philippines as well as utilize their proximity to the equator This allows for extending business hours in rural health clinics which could better accommodate community members schedules making services more inclusive and equitable  Educational Attainment  Access to education is a social determinant of health as people with higher degrees of education more likely to live longer and be healthier Socioeconomic status impacts the likelihood that a child will graduate high school and continue to college Without a high school or college degree people are less likely to obtain a high paying job which is associated with an increased risk of health problems such as heart disease diabetes and depression People from rural communities are more likely to have a lower socioeconomic status and have lower educational attainment compared to urban residents The percentage of adults who did not graduate high school has decreased from 236 to 131 in rural areas and 188 to 114 in urban areas between 19602019 demonstrating the improvement in educational attainment over time Despite the progress made there still exists disparities as the percentage of urban residents with a bachelors degree or higher in 2019 was 347 compared to 21 of rural residents The impact of education on health status extends beyond income level as less education is a risk factor for having low health literacy Health literacy is the ability for a patient to understand health information and how to manage their health by following instructions from their provider People with low health literacy are less likely to have health screening and seek preventative healthcare services putting them at risk for having a poorer health status and hospitalization Health education programs in rural areas can be implemented to improve health literacy and health outcomes in these communities  Community Engagement  Community participation and sustained partnerships between healthcare providers and community members is key to delivering effective rural healthcare Community members are important stakeholders and their perspectives about their health needs and utilization patterns the health care they can afford to access and the quality of care they receive should be viewed as expert evidence when devising rural health care policies Functional participation involves forming groups to meet existing objectives that are related to a particular goal Active participation can be integrated through decisionmaking efforts that are open to all members of the community Specifically when improving transportation in rural areas community members should be consulted to provide their own ideas and have individual roles throughout the project Support systems should be in place for locals to be involved in critical decisionmaking as well as voice their opinions with equal stakes without feared backlash Telemedicine and ehealth solutions are also helping outreach to rural patients in places like the rural Eastern Cape in South Africa Community participation encourages people living in rural communities to take care of their mental and physical health and empowers them to practice healthy living  A Renewed Focus on Rural Health Worldwide   National Systems  Since the mid1980s there has been increased attention on the discrepancies in healthcare outcomes between individuals in rural areas and those in urban areas Since that time there has been increased funding by governments and nongovernmental organizations to research rural health provide needed medical services and incorporate the needs of rural areas into governmental healthcare policy Some countries have started rural proofing programs to ensure that the needs of rural communities including rural health are incorporated into national policies Research centers such as the Center for Rural and Northern Health Research at Laurentian University the Center for Rural Health at the University of North Dakota and the RUPRI Center and rural health advocacy groups such as the National Rural Health Association National Organization of State Offices of Rural Health and National Rural Health Alliance have been developed in several nations to inform and combat rural health issues In Canada many provinces have started to decentralize primary care and move towards a more regional approach The Local Health Integration Network was established in Ontario in 2007 order to address the needs of the many Ontarians living in rural northern and remote areas The Canadian Institute for Health Information has developed the Rural Health Systems Model to support decisionmakers and planners with understanding factors that affect rural health system performance and the Rural Health Services Decision Guide to support decisions surrounding provision of rural health services In China a US 50 million pilot project was approved in 2008 to improve public health in rural areas China is also planning to introduce a national health care system  World Health Organization  The World Health Organization WHO has done many studies on rural health statistics showing that urban heath centers score significantly higher in service readiness than rural health centers Research studies like these exemplify the major problems needing attention in rural health systems and help lead to more impactful improvement projects Retention of rural health workers remains a major challenge The WHO also works on evaluation health system improvements and proposing better health system improvements An article published in March 2017 highlighted the large improvement to be made in the Solomon Islands health system in a plan laid out by the Ministry of Health and Medical Services supported by the WHO These large scale changes move to bring health services needed by the rural population closer to home  Nongovernmental organizations NGOs  Lack of government intervention in failing health systems has led to the need for NGOs to fill the void in many rural health care systems NGOs create and participate in rural health projects worldwide  Rural health projects  Rural health improvement projects worldwide tend to focus on finding solutions to the three main problems associated with a rural health system communication systems transportation of services and goods and healthcare worker shortages Due to the lack of access to professional medical care one approach to improving rural healthcare is distributing health information in an understandable way such as the Hesperian Health Guides book Where There is No Doctor and World Hope Internationals app mBody Health These tools provide information on diseases and treatments to help community members navigate their health however there is little evidence that this approach improves health outcomes Other community based programs focus on promoting health behaviors and increasing utilization of available health resources such as the mother and infant health program called the Sure Start Project in rural India An evaluation of the organization showed that community organization surrounding maternal and infant health improvement leads to increased use of health services and improvement in the health of the mother Similarly the Consejo de Salud Rural Andino CSRA in Bolivia has improved healthcare for rural communities by promoting community education and healthcare clinics Evaluations of this organization have found that implementation of the CSRA has effectively reduced the under5 mortality rate in rural Bolivia In the United States the Health Resources and Services Administration funds the Small Rural Hospital Improvement Program SHIP to improve the quality of care for hospitals with fewer than 49 beds Eula Hall founded the Mud Creek Clinic in Grethel Kentucky to provide free and reducedpriced healthcare to residents of Appalachia In Indiana St Vincent Health implemented the Rural and Urban Access to Health to enhance access to care for underserved populations including Hispanic migrant workers As of December 2012 the program had facilitated more than 78000 referrals to care and enabled the distribution of US 437 million worth of free or reducedcost prescription drugs Owing to the challenges of providing rural healthcare services worldwide the nonprofit group Remote Area Medical RAM began as an effort to provide care in thirdworld nations but now provide services primarily in the US In 2002 NGOs provided 40 percent of clinical care needs 27 percent of hospital beds and 35 percent of outpatient services for people in Ghana The conditions of the Ghanaian Healthcare system was dire during the early 80s due to a lack of supplies and trained healthcare professionals Structural adjustment policies caused the cost of health services to rise significantly NGOs like Oxfam are rebalancing the brain drain that remaining healthcare professionals feel as well as provide human capital to provide necessary health services to the Ghanaian people In Ecuador organizations such as Child Family Health Organization CFHI promote the implementation of medical pluralism by furthering the knowledge of traditional medicine as practiced by Indigenous peoples in a westernizing country Medical pluralism arises as a deliberate approach to resolving the tension between urban and rural health and is manifested in the practice of integrative medicine There are currently ongoing efforts to implement this system regionally more particularly in the nation of Ecuador It accomplishes the mission of raising awareness for more adequate healthcare systems by immersing participants including health care practitioners and student volunteers in programs both inperson and virtually that are rooted in community involvement and provide glimpses into the healthcare systems present in vastly distinct areas of the nation Research examines the role of NGOs in facilitating spaces or arenas for spotlighting the importance of traditional medicine and medical pluralism such arenas facilitate a necessary medical dialogue about healthcare and provides a space to hear the voices of marginalized communities CFHIs efforts are supporting Ecuadors implementation of an integrated system that includes alternative medicine The process of doing so is however challenged by four main obstacles These four obstacles include organizational culture financial viability patient experience and physical space and lastly credentialing The obstacles continue to challenge the ongoing work of CFHI and other NGOs as they aim to establish a healthcare system that represents the ethnic diversity of the nation In Peru the presence of certain key organizations such as USAID PIH and UNICEF as well as more local NGOs have greatly spearheaded the efforts of establishing a system suitable for the diverse populations of the country As governments continue to function under the assumption that communities have access to the same resources and live under the same conditions and sets of exposures their support of Westernized modes of healthcare are inadequate at meeting the varying needs communities and individuals These systems overgeneralize the needs of the populations and perpetuate harmful cycles by believing that medical practices and procedures can apply to anyone regardless of their environment socioeconomic status and color of their skin when reality proves otherwise Such systemic failures contribute to a reliance on external NGOs to promote a more equitable healthcare system In the Philippines Child and Family Health International CFHI is a 501c3 nonprofit organization that works on global health in Quezon Lubang and Romblon Philippines focusing on primary care and health justice by offering health services and promoting health education The Philippines program works through urban and rural clinicshealth stations respectively in Manila and the villages on remote islands known as geographically isolated disadvantaged areas Their main goal to achieve health equity and social justice is carried out through leadership of local Filipinos and partnerships with community groups Although universal healthcare is in place in the Philippines CFHI addresses persisting inequities and disparities in rural and lowincome communities  Telemedicine and rural health  For residents of rural areas the lengthy travel time and distance to larger more developed urban and metropolitan health centers present significant restrictions on access to essential healthcare services Telemedicine has been suggested as a way of overcoming transportation barriers for patients and health care providers in rural and geographically isolated areas Telemedicine uses electronic information and telecommunication technologies such as video calls to support longdistance healthcare and clinical relationships Telemedicine provides clinical educational and administrative benefits for rural areas that have access to these technological outlets Telemedicine eases the burden of clinical services by the utilization of electronic technology in the direct interaction between health care providers such as primary and specialist health providers nurses and technologists and patients in the diagnosis treatment and management of diseases and illnesses For example if a rural hospital does not have a physician on duty they may be able to use telemedicine systems to get help from a physician in another location during a medical emergency The advantage of telemedicine on educational services includes the delivery of healthcare related lectures and workshops through video and teleconferencing practical simulations and webcasting In rural communities medical professionals may utilize prerecorded lectures for medical or healthcare students at remote sites Also healthcare practitioners in urban and metropolitan areas may utilize teleconferences and diagnostic simulations to assist understaffed healthcare centers in rural communities in diagnosing and treating patients from a distance In a study of rural Queensland health systems more developed urban health centers used video conferencing to educate rural physicians on treatment and diagnostic advancements for breast and prostate cancer as well as various skin disorders such as eczema and chronic irritations Telemedicine may offer administrative benefits to rural areas Not only does telemedicine aid in the collaboration among health providers with regard to the utilization of electronic medical records but telemedicine may offer benefits for interviewing medical professionals in remote areas for position vacancies and the transmission of necessary operationrelated information between rural health systems and larger more developed healthcare systems While telehealth services have been beneficial to improving access to care there are still challenges that remain to provide this care in rural areas Many rural communities are not equipped with internet connection or technology necessary for a patient to access telehealth services within their home A survey conducted in 2019 found that people living in rural areas are twice as likely to not have access to the internet connection than urban counterparts Additionally lack of internet access was more prevalent among the elderly population and within racial and ethnic minority communities which could contribute to the existing disparities in accessing care  COVID19 pandemic Impacts on Rural Health   Economics  The pandemic of coronavirus which began in 2019 had serious negative impacts on people around the globe from financial and mental health troubles to long term disability and death However most of the data and statistics presented in the news was collected in urban areas Before the pandemic people in rural areas were already struggling with low incomes and low social mobility During the pandemic in order to minimize the spread of the virus many businesses were temporarily closed On one hand rural people were actually more likely to keep working than urban people They were more likely to be essential workers often in agricultural jobs growing and harvesting food However the closures in urban and suburban areas eventually impacted the selling prices of goods produced in rural areas In a study done in Italy they found that the individuals in the rural areas were less likely to be exposed to the virus because of the smaller population sizes In these areas the residents live far away from one another Their social interactions were already limited before the pandemic began The study indicated that taking advantage of the distance can help reduce the spread Spending time and money to revitalize rural areas can help form a more sustainable model of better using local resources to help aid in any future incidences  Following health recommendations  The individuals living in the rural communities are also less likely to follow prevention behaviors that were recommended Compared to the 8455 of urban residents who wore masks only 7365 of rural residents did Wearing masks werent the only preventative measures that rural residents didnt do as often They also were less likely to sanitize their living spaces social distance and work from home Once the COVID19 vaccine was created the individuals in rural communities were hesitant to get them Already rural residents were less likely to get vaccines than those in urban areas A survey done by the CDC in 2018 showed that rural residents were 18 less likely to get the HPV vaccine and 20 less likely to get the Meningococcal conjugate vaccine than urban residents  Health care  The health care in general in rural areas has always been struggling The lack of health care providers has made it difficult for residents to get the care that they might need without going to the big city With the COVID19 outbreak more medical professionals were needed and more equipments and regulations were required Rural communities have a higher percentage of an older population and they are more susceptible to the virus Finding ways and people to care for them when they got sick became even more difficult Rural communities also tend to have a lower rates of health literacy Health literacy is an individuals ability to access health information to understand it and to apply it in ways that promote good health This makes it harder to protect individuals when they cant effectively communicate with their health care providers  Health Disparities in United States Rural Populations   Spatial Disparities in Health  While the definition of rurality is debated spatially related disparities are a prominent health problem Rural sociologists have considered the importance of the urbanrural spatial continuum for some time In the United States the field of rural sociology is inherently based on the assumption that generalizations made about urban populations are not able to be applied to rural ones Linda Lobao a prominent rural sociologist states Rural populations were argued to be fundamentally different in their social organization norms values and a host of other attributes In a paper published in Rural Sociology from 1942 Dorn shares his concerns about US disparities of infant and maternal mortality rates and what he refers to as sickness morbidity rates juxtaposed with the relatively lower number of physicians and hospitals in the rural areas He surmises that the typical public health activities have exclusively focused on sanitation and controlling communicable disease leaves little to no money for direct medical care  Rural Residence as a Social Determinant of Health  More recently public health has also identified spatial disparities as a key component of inequity Lutfiyya et al contend that rurality is a root or fundamental social determinant of health Social determinants of health such as poverty unequal access to healthcare education deficits stigma and racism are all contributing factors to health inequalities according to the CDC Research on placebased determinants have historically pointed towards urbanization eg redlining gentrification but health disparities also persist in rural areas as well For example 20 of the population in the United States is considered rural but only 9 of physicians serve rural communities which points to unequal access to healthcare Cosby et al refers to the differences in mortality and morbidity between urban and rural residents as the rural mortality penalty Lutfiyya et al discuss the introduction to the theory of fundamental causes of health and mortality by Link and Phelan and its important omission of rurality and space While socioeconomic status is fundamentally understood to be a persistent driver of health inequity this concept was not expanded to include root causes spurring the socioeconomic disparities Using the four features which characterize a fundamental social cause of health Lutfiyya et al demonstrate that rural residency is a root cause of health inequities The aforementioned four characteristics are 1 it influences multiple disease or health outcomes 2 it affects these outcomes through multiple risk factors 3 it impacts access to resources that may be used to either avoid risks or minimize the consequence of disease and 4 the association between the fundamental cause and health is reproduced over time through the replacement of intervening mechanisms  Nuances of US Rural Populations  About 14 of the US population lives in a designated rural area which is about 461 million people Despite assumptions about the homogeneity of rural populations in the US the rural population at large varies greatly amongst itself and between the urban and suburban populations For the first time in US census history individuals 65 and older made up more than 20 of the rural population in 2021 For metropolitan areas in 2021 people 65 and older only made up 16 of the population Throughout the decade of 201020 65 years and older population in rural areas grew by 22 While the rural workforce has become more racially and ethnically diverse than previous years it is still less diverse than urban populations Towne et al found racial differences in health outcomes For example white and Black rural residents were less likely to report being in good or excellent health when compared to their urban colleagues Rural Black residents were less likely to have cholesterol and cervical cancer screenings when compared to their urban counterparts Another study found that white and Black rural residents were more vulnerable to higher mortality rates Another study found that place rurality influenced greater mortality across all racial and ethnic groups When compared to urban subpopulations rural white residents had a 13 increased chance of mortality rural Black residents had an 8 increased chance of mortality and rural American IndianAlaskan Natives had an 162 increased chance of mortality  Disease Prevalence in US Rural Areas   Coronary Heart Disease  Taylor writes about some of the disparities in disease prevalence comparing rural and urban residents She identifies several areas of particular note including heart disease unintentional injuries and cancer Coronary heart disease CHD is the leading cause of death in the United States CHD mortality is more prevalent among rural men and women compared to their urban counterparts For rural residents the unexpected excess deaths from CHS was almost 43 for individuals younger than 80 years old compared to 278 for urban residents between 1999 and 2014 Taylor notes that while mortality caused by CHD have declined overall the decrease was tied to urbanization levels Past research has found that there are greater distances to healthcare centers healthcare provider shortages and greater lack of adherence to healthy behaviors as well as lower selfefficacy for selfmanagement among heart failure patients While physical activity improves cardiac health physical inactivity and obesity are greater in rural areas Depression is also a critical risk factor for heart disease and is associated with elevated morbidity and mortality risk for CHD among rural populations  Unintentional Injuries  Taylor also discusses unintentional injuries as a broad category that is more prevalent among rural populations than urban ones In particular injuries tied to poisonings transportation and falls were the top three causes for unintentional injuries causing death among rural groups Taylor reports that mortality rates for unintentional injuries between 1999 and 2014 surpassed urban counties by 50 In particular opioid misuse and deaths accounted for a large portion of these differences Further the ageadjusted rate of drug overdose deaths increased by 31 from 2019 to 2020 Related to healthcare disparities rural patients face inadequate access to drug treatment facilities and often emergency medical ambulatory services did not have the appropriate medical supplies to treat individuals who overdosed at the site of an emergency Additionally ambulatory services will often have to travel farther to attend to or transport patients compared to their urban counterparts which could have grave impacts on a patients status if time to treatment is influential on their odds of recovery According to the CDC deaths related to motor vehicle crashes are 310 times higher in rural areas than urban ones depending on their region Specifically fatalities from crashes was relatively higher in rural areas than urban ones in 2015 48 vs 45 Relatedly seatbelt use is lower for rural divers with 61 of drivers and passengers involved in fatal crashes in rural counties did not have their seat belts on at the time of the crash Compared to urban drivers drivers in rural areas who encountered a fatal crash and were killed at the scene was 61 compared to 33  Cancer  The incidence rates for breast prostate lung colorectal and cervix cancers were higher among rural residents Further while overall cancer incidence was lower among rural individuals the mortality cancer rates for rural populations outpaced that of their urban counterparts Cancer mortality rates have been declining however this decline has been much slower for rural residents Taylor notes that risk factors related to cancers of the lung colon rectum prostate cervix oral cavity and pharynx can be modified For example rural residents are more likely to be obese smoke be exposed to secondhand smoke lack of physical activity and be exposed to UV rays Singh et al found that increases in lung cancer mortality and the degree of rurality were consistent with higher risk factors  Healthcare Disparities in the United States  Rural populations not only experience greater mortality and morbidity in the areas mentioned above but they also encounter healthcare disparities which are defined as differences in access to or availability of medical facilities and services and variation in rates of disease occurrence and disabilities between population groups defined by socioeconomic characteristics such as age ethnicity economic resources or gender and populations identified geographically Centers for Medicare  Medicaid Services report that only 12 of physicians practice in rural areas despite 61 of health professional shortage areas being located in rural areas Further specialty and subspecialty services are less likely to be offered in rural areas A University of Minnesota report found that of the rural health clinic staff members surveyed 64 of them reported difficulty finding specialists for patient referral While telehealth services have been a safeguard for patient living in rural areas However broadband and computer access can be critical limitations for those without stable or consistent access
