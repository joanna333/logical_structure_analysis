Bregma,The bregma is the anatomical point on the skull at which the coronal suture is intersected perpendicularly by the sagittal suture  Structure  The bregma is located at the intersection of the coronal suture and the sagittal suture on the superior middle portion of the calvaria It is the point where the frontal bone and the two parietal bones meet  Development  The bregma is known as the anterior fontanelle during infancy The anterior fontanelle is membranous and closes in the first 1836 months of life  Clinical significance   Cleidocranial dysostosis  In the birth defect cleidocranial dysostosis the anterior fontanelle never closes to form the bregma  Surgical landmark  The bregma is often used as a reference point for stereotactic surgery of the brain It may be identified by blunt scraping of the surface of the skull and washing to make the meeting point of the sutures clearer  Neonatal examination  Examination of an infant includes palpating the anterior fontanelle It should be flat soft and less than 35cm across A sunken fontanelle indicates dehydration whereas a very tense or bulging anterior fontanelle indicates raised intracranial pressure  Height assessment  Cranial height is defined as the distance between the bregma and the midpoint of the foramen magnum the basion This is strongly linked to more general growth This can be used to assess the general health of a deceased person as part of an archaeological excavation giving information on the health of a population  Etymology  The word bregma comes from the Ancient Greek βρέγμα brégma meaning the bone directly above the brain
