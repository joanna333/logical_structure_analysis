Sentence 1,Sentence 2,Relationship
"Chronic kidney disease (CKD) involves several pathophysiological changes, including  the progressive loss of nephron function over months or years","This loss leads to  accumulation of waste products and excess fluid in the body, which is  a key symptom of CKD",Cause and Effect
"This loss leads to  accumulation of waste products and excess fluid in the body, which is  a key symptom of CKD","The kidneys fail to  filter blood effectively, which  results in a buildup of waste products like urea and creatinine",Cause and Effect
"The kidneys fail to  filter blood effectively, which  results in a buildup of waste products like urea and creatinine","As CKD progresses,  the glomeruli become damaged, reducing the kidneys' ability to reabsorb essential substances like sodium, potassium, and phosphate, leading to  imbalances that affect other body systems",Cause and Effect
"As CKD progresses,  the glomeruli become damaged, reducing the kidneys' ability to reabsorb essential substances like sodium, potassium, and phosphate, leading to  imbalances that affect other body systems","The  impaired filtration also means that the kidneys cannot secrete waste products efficiently, contributing to their accumulation",Cause and Effect
"The  impaired filtration also means that the kidneys cannot secrete waste products efficiently, contributing to their accumulation","Systemic effects of CKD include  hypertension, anemia, and bone disease, all of which are  directly linked to the kidneys' reduced function",Cause and Effect
"Systemic effects of CKD include  hypertension, anemia, and bone disease, all of which are  directly linked to the kidneys' reduced function","The  increased retention of erythropoietin due to renal failure leads to anemia, while high blood pressure is partly due to the retention of sodium and water",Cause and Effect
"The  increased retention of erythropoietin due to renal failure leads to anemia, while high blood pressure is partly due to the retention of sodium and water","Moreover, CKD can lead to  acid-base imbalances, as the kidneys are less able to excrete hydrogen ions, which can be  corrected through dietary adjustments or medication",Cause and Effect
"Moreover, CKD can lead to  acid-base imbalances, as the kidneys are less able to excrete hydrogen ions, which can be  corrected through dietary adjustments or medication",The  systemic effects of CKD underscore the importance of early detection and management to slow disease progression and improve quality of life,Cause and Effect
The  systemic effects of CKD underscore the importance of early detection and management to slow disease progression and improve quality of life,"In summary, CKD is",Cause and Effect
