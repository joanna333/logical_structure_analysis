Sentence 1,Sentence 2,Relationship
"During exercise, the body's energy demands increase, and  as a result, metabolic changes occur",One of the primary metabolic changes is an increase in substrate utilization,Cause and Effect
One of the primary metabolic changes is an increase in substrate utilization,The body turns to glycogen stored in the muscles and liver for  energy production through glycolysis,Cause and Effect
The body turns to glycogen stored in the muscles and liver for  energy production through glycolysis,"This process is initiated to quickly provide ATP, the energy currency of the cell, to contracting muscles",Cause and Effect
"This process is initiated to quickly provide ATP, the energy currency of the cell, to contracting muscles","When glycogen stores are depleted,  the body begins to utilize fats and, to a lesser extent, proteins for energy",Cause and Effect
"When glycogen stores are depleted,  the body begins to utilize fats and, to a lesser extent, proteins for energy",This shift is a metabolic adaptation to sustain exercise over longer periods,Cause and Effect
This shift is a metabolic adaptation to sustain exercise over longer periods,"Fats are broken down into fatty acids, which are then  transported to the mitochondria for beta-oxidation",Cause and Effect
"Fats are broken down into fatty acids, which are then  transported to the mitochondria for beta-oxidation","This process generates acetyl CoA, which enters the Krebs cycle to produce NADH and FADH2",Cause and Effect
"This process generates acetyl CoA, which enters the Krebs cycle to produce NADH and FADH2",The increased demand for ATP during exercise also stimulates  the release of hormones like adrenaline and cortisol,Cause and Effect
The increased demand for ATP during exercise also stimulates  the release of hormones like adrenaline and cortisol,"These hormones facilitate the mobilization of glucose from the bloodstream, ensuring a continuous energy supply",Cause and Effect
"These hormones facilitate the mobilization of glucose from the bloodstream, ensuring a continuous energy supply","Muscle cells undergo changes such as increased capillary density and mitochondria proliferation,  which enhance their ability to utilize substrates more efficiently",Cause and Effect
"Muscle cells undergo changes such as increased capillary density and mitochondria proliferation,  which enhance their ability to utilize substrates more efficiently","These adaptations are long-term responses to regular exercise, improving overall metabolic capacity",Cause and Effect
"These adaptations are long-term responses to regular exercise, improving overall metabolic capacity","In summary, exercise triggers a cascade of metabolic changes focused on increasing energy production and substrate utilization",Cause and Effect
"In summary, exercise triggers a cascade of metabolic changes focused on increasing energy production and substrate utilization",The body dynamically switches between different substrates and metabolic pathways to,Cause and Effect
