Sentence 1,Sentence 2,Relationship
The tendon reflex is a rapid muscle contraction evoked by stretching a tendon,The physiological basis involves sensory neurons detecting the stretch and sending signals to the spinal cord,Cause and Effect
The physiological basis involves sensory neurons detecting the stretch and sending signals to the spinal cord,"The spinal cord then sends a signal back to the muscle, causing it to contract",Cause and Effect
"The spinal cord then sends a signal back to the muscle, causing it to contract",This reflex is important for maintaining posture and protecting muscles from injury,Cause and Effect
This reflex is important for maintaining posture and protecting muscles from injury,"For instance, when the doctor taps your knee, the tap stretches the tendon, triggering the reflex to move your leg away",Cause and Effect
"For instance, when the doctor taps your knee, the tap stretches the tendon, triggering the reflex to move your leg away","The reflex arc is quick, which is crucial for immediate protective responses",Cause and Effect
"The reflex arc is quick, which is crucial for immediate protective responses","In clinical settings, tendon reflexes are tested to assess the integrity of the nervous system",Cause and Effect
"In clinical settings, tendon reflexes are tested to assess the integrity of the nervous system","Abnormal reflexes can indicate neurological issues, such as damage to the spinal cord",Cause and Effect
"Abnormal reflexes can indicate neurological issues, such as damage to the spinal cord","Therefore, tendon reflexes are not only a physiological curiosity but a vital clinical tool",Cause and Effect
