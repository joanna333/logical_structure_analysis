Sentence 1,Sentence 2,Relationship
The iris of the eye controls pupil dilation and constriction,Light sensitivity is a key factor that causes pupil dilation,Cause and Effect
Light sensitivity is a key factor that causes pupil dilation,"In low light conditions, the iris relaxes, allowing the pupil to dilate, letting more light enter the eye",Cause and Effect
"In low light conditions, the iris relaxes, allowing the pupil to dilate, letting more light enter the eye","Conversely, in bright light, the iris contracts, making the pupil smaller to reduce the amount of light entering the eye",Cause and Effect
"Conversely, in bright light, the iris contracts, making the pupil smaller to reduce the amount of light entering the eye","The autonomic nervous system influences these changes, responding to light exposure and adjusting the pupil size accordingly",Cause and Effect
"The autonomic nervous system influences these changes, responding to light exposure and adjusting the pupil size accordingly","Pupil constriction and dilation are involuntary actions, controlled by the brain to optimize vision",Cause and Effect
"Pupil constriction and dilation are involuntary actions, controlled by the brain to optimize vision",These processes are crucial for maintaining clear vision under varying light conditions,Cause and Effect
These processes are crucial for maintaining clear vision under varying light conditions,Understanding these mechanisms helps in diagnosing eye disorders that affect pupil function,Cause and Effect
Understanding these mechanisms helps in diagnosing eye disorders that affect pupil function,"Thus, light sensitivity and the autonomic nervous system work together to adjust pupil size for optimal vision",Cause and Effect
