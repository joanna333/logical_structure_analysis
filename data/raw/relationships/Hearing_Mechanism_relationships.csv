Sentence 1,Sentence 2,Relationship
The cochlea is a snail-shaped structure in the inner ear crucial for hearing,"Sound waves enter the ear and vibrate the eardrum, triggering a chain reaction",Cause and Effect
"Sound waves enter the ear and vibrate the eardrum, triggering a chain reaction",These vibrations pass through the middle ear bones to the cochlea,Cause and Effect
These vibrations pass through the middle ear bones to the cochlea,"Inside the cochlea, hair cells convert mechanical vibrations into electrical signals",Cause and Effect
"Inside the cochlea, hair cells convert mechanical vibrations into electrical signals",The auditory nerve then carries these signals to the brain for processing,Cause and Effect
The auditory nerve then carries these signals to the brain for processing,"The brain interprets these signals as sound, allowing us to hear",Cause and Effect
"The brain interprets these signals as sound, allowing us to hear",The cochlea and auditory pathways work together to enable hearing,Cause and Effect
The cochlea and auditory pathways work together to enable hearing,"Without the cochlea, sound waves would not be converted into neural signals",Cause and Effect
"Without the cochlea, sound waves would not be converted into neural signals",The auditory pathways ensure that information about sound reaches the brain efficiently,Cause and Effect
The auditory pathways ensure that information about sound reaches the brain efficiently,"Together, they form the complex system that allows us to perceive sound",Cause and Effect
"Together, they form the complex system that allows us to perceive sound",Understanding their physiology helps in diagnosing and treating hearing impairments,Cause and Effect
Understanding their physiology helps in diagnosing and treating hearing impairments,The cochlea and auditory pathways are essential components of the hearing process,Cause and Effect
