Sentence 1,Sentence 2,Relationship
Muscle fatigue occurs for several reasons,"One cause is prolonged physical activity, which leads to a depletion of energy sources in the muscles",Cause and Effect
"One cause is prolonged physical activity, which leads to a depletion of energy sources in the muscles","Another cause is the buildup of metabolic byproducts such as lactic acid, which can interfere with muscle function",Cause and Effect
"Another cause is the buildup of metabolic byproducts such as lactic acid, which can interfere with muscle function",The physiological adaptations to muscle fatigue include increased blood flow to carry away waste products,Cause and Effect
The physiological adaptations to muscle fatigue include increased blood flow to carry away waste products,Muscles also experience changes in ion exchange across the cell membrane to maintain electrical potential,Cause and Effect
Muscles also experience changes in ion exchange across the cell membrane to maintain electrical potential,"Additionally, there is an increase in the production of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to replenish energy stores",Cause and Effect
"Additionally, there is an increase in the production of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to replenish energy stores",These adaptations help muscles continue to function despite fatigue,Cause and Effect
These adaptations help muscles continue to function despite fatigue,Muscle fibers rely on a constant supply of oxygen and nutrients to sustain contraction,Cause and Effect
Muscle fibers rely on a constant supply of oxygen and nutrients to sustain contraction,"When these supplies are depleted, muscle fatigue sets in",Cause and Effect
"When these supplies are depleted, muscle fatigue sets in",The body responds by recruiting more muscle fibers and increasing the heart rate to enhance blood flow,Cause and Effect
The body responds by recruiting more muscle fibers and increasing the heart rate to enhance blood flow,"This process, however, can only compensate for a certain period before fatigue becomes inevitable",Cause and Effect
"This process, however, can only compensate for a certain period before fatigue becomes inevitable","Muscles also adapt by switching to anaerobic metabolism, which produces lactic acid as a byproduct",Cause and Effect
"Muscles also adapt by switching to anaerobic metabolism, which produces lactic acid as a byproduct",Lactic acid accumulation can lead to muscle burning and decreased muscle contractility,Cause and Effect
Lactic acid accumulation can lead to muscle burning and decreased muscle contractility,Muscle fatigue is not just a local phenomenon within the muscle but involves the nervous system as well,Cause and Effect
Muscle fatigue is not just a local phenomenon within the muscle but involves the nervous system as well,The central nervous system may limit muscle activation to prevent further damage,Cause and Effect
The central nervous system may limit muscle activation to prevent further damage,This protective mechanism is a form of negative feedback where the brain senses excessive fatigue and reduces neural drive to the muscles -[Cause and,Cause and Effect
