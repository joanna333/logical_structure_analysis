Sentence 1,Sentence 2,Relationship
Skeletal muscles contract through a complex process involving myofibrils,Myofibrils are composed of repeating units called sarcomeres,Cause and Effect
Myofibrils are composed of repeating units called sarcomeres,Each sarcomere contains thin filaments of actin and thick filaments of myosin,Cause and Effect
Each sarcomere contains thin filaments of actin and thick filaments of myosin,The contraction begins when the nervous system sends an electrical signal to the muscle,Cause and Effect
The contraction begins when the nervous system sends an electrical signal to the muscle,This signal triggers the release of calcium ions into the sarcoplasm,Cause and Effect
This signal triggers the release of calcium ions into the sarcoplasm,"Calcium binds to troponin, a protein associated with the thin filaments",Cause and Effect
"Calcium binds to troponin, a protein associated with the thin filaments","This binding changes the shape of tropomyosin, exposing the binding sites on actin",Cause and Effect
"This binding changes the shape of tropomyosin, exposing the binding sites on actin","Myosin heads, which are attached to the thick filaments, attach to the exposed actin binding sites",Cause and Effect
"Myosin heads, which are attached to the thick filaments, attach to the exposed actin binding sites","The myosin heads then undergo a power stroke, pulling the actin filaments towards the center of the sarcomere",Cause and Effect
"The myosin heads then undergo a power stroke, pulling the actin filaments towards the center of the sarcomere","This sliding of filaments shortens the sarcomere, leading to muscle contraction",Cause and Effect
"This sliding of filaments shortens the sarcomere, leading to muscle contraction","The contraction ceases when calcium is actively pumped back into the sarcoplasmic reticulum, detaching myosin from actin",Cause and Effect
"The contraction ceases when calcium is actively pumped back into the sarcoplasmic reticulum, detaching myosin from actin","The filaments return to their original positions, lengthening the sarcomere and relaxing the muscle",Cause and Effect
"The filaments return to their original positions, lengthening the sarcomere and relaxing the muscle",This cycle of contraction and relaxation is how skeletal muscles perform their functions,Cause and Effect
This cycle of contraction and relaxation is how skeletal muscles perform their functions,"The molecular mechanisms of myofibril contraction in skeletal muscles involve a series of precise interactions between actin, myosin, calcium ions, and regulatory proteins",Cause and Effect
"The molecular mechanisms of myofibril contraction in skeletal muscles involve a series of precise interactions between actin, myosin, calcium ions, and regulatory proteins",These interactions,Cause and Effect
