Sentence 1,Sentence 2,Relationship
"Under extreme environmental conditions, organisms employ various mechanisms to maintain their body temperature, a process known as thermoregulation","When it's extremely hot, animals may engage in evaporative cooling, such as sweating or panting, to reduce body heat",Cause and Effect
"When it's extremely hot, animals may engage in evaporative cooling, such as sweating or panting, to reduce body heat","On the contrary, in freezing cold, mammals often increase their metabolic rate to generate heat, a process called shivering thermogenesis",Cause and Effect
"On the contrary, in freezing cold, mammals often increase their metabolic rate to generate heat, a process called shivering thermogenesis","Hibernating animals, like bears, lower their metabolic rate and body temperature to conserve energy during winter, illustrating a temporary suspension of thermoregulation",Contrast
"Hibernating animals, like bears, lower their metabolic rate and body temperature to conserve energy during winter, illustrating a temporary suspension of thermoregulation","Birds have feathers that insulate and help retain heat, crucial in cold climates",Cause and Effect
"Birds have feathers that insulate and help retain heat, crucial in cold climates","In contrast, desert animals often have large surface areas relative to their volume to dissipate heat, a strategy to survive high temperatures",Contrast
"In contrast, desert animals often have large surface areas relative to their volume to dissipate heat, a strategy to survive high temperatures",Thermoregulation is essential for survival as it ensures that internal body functions operate within a safe temperature range,Cause and Effect
Thermoregulation is essential for survival as it ensures that internal body functions operate within a safe temperature range,"Despite these mechanisms, some organisms may not be able to adapt sufficiently to extreme conditions, leading to potential risks of overheating or freezing",Cause and Effect
"Despite these mechanisms, some organisms may not be able to adapt sufficiently to extreme conditions, leading to potential risks of overheating or freezing","In summary, thermoregulation under extreme conditions involves various strategies to maintain a stable internal temperature, crucial for life",Cause and Effect
