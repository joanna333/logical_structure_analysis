Sentence 1,Sentence 2,Relationship
Pulmonary surfactant is a crucial substance in the lungs,It reduces the surface tension at the air-liquid interface in the alveoli,Cause and Effect
It reduces the surface tension at the air-liquid interface in the alveoli,This reduction is essential for alveolar stability,Cause and Effect
This reduction is essential for alveolar stability,"Without surfactant, the alveoli would collapse after each exhalation",Cause and Effect
"Without surfactant, the alveoli would collapse after each exhalation","Surfactant improves lung compliance, making it easier to inflate the lungs",Cause and Effect
"Surfactant improves lung compliance, making it easier to inflate the lungs",The presence of surfactant allows the lungs to expand and contract with less effort,Cause and Effect
The presence of surfactant allows the lungs to expand and contract with less effort,"Surfactant-deficient lungs experience decreased compliance, leading to respiratory distress",Cause and Effect
"Surfactant-deficient lungs experience decreased compliance, leading to respiratory distress","Thus, pulmonary surfactant plays a vital role in maintaining healthy lung function",Cause and Effect
