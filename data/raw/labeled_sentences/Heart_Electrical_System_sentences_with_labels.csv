This coordinated sequence ensures that blood is efficiently pumped throughout the body.,Explanation
"In contrast, if any part of this system malfunctions, it can lead to arrhythmias.",Contrast
Understanding these components is vital for diagnosing and treating heart rhythm disorders.,Purpose
"In summary, the SA node starts the heartbeat, the AV node regulates it, and the Purkinje fibers ensure efficient contraction.",Summary
Each component plays a critical role in the electrical conduction system of the heart.,Emphasis
"Together, they form a complex network that maintains the heart's rhythm and function.",Explanation
Any disruption in this system can have serious implications for heart health.,Generalization
