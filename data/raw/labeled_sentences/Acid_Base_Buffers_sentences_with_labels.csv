"The human body employs several buffering systems to maintain pH balance, which is crucial for the proper functioning of cells and organs.",Definition
One of the key buffering systems is the bicarbonate buffer system.,Definition
"This system involves carbon dioxide (CO2), water (H2O), and bicarbonate ions (HCO3-).",Explanation
"The bicarbonate ions then bind with hydrogen ions, preventing a significant change in pH.",Explanation
"This binding action acts as a buffer, absorbing excess hydrogen ions and maintaining the body's pH within a narrow range.",Explanation
The bicarbonate buffer system is particularly important in the blood and extracellular fluid.,Generalization
It helps regulate pH during periods of increased metabolic activity or when external acids are introduced.,Explanation
"Without effective buffering, even slight pH changes could be lethal to cells.",Emphasis
"Therefore, the bicarbonate buffer system is vital for homeostasis in the human body.",Emphasis
