Sentence,Label
Neural plasticity refers to the brain's ability to reorganize itself by forming new neural connections throughout life.,Definition
"For instance, after a stroke, neural plasticity can help the brain relearn movements by strengthening connections in healthy parts of the brain.",Illustration
"In contrast, without neural plasticity, the brain would be less capable of adapting to changes or injuries, potentially leading to more severe and long-lasting deficits.",Contrast
Understanding neural plasticity is essential for developing effective rehabilitation strategies that harness the brain's ability to heal and adapt.,Purpose
"In summary, neural plasticity is a fundamental property of the brain that supports learning and recovery, making it a key area of study in neuroscience.",Summary
"Despite its importance, the mechanisms of neural plasticity are complex and not fully understood, which presents a challenge for researchers.",Explanation
"In conclusion, neural plasticity is a dynamic process that underlies the brain's capacity to learn and adapt, playing a critical role in both normal development and recovery from injury.",Summary
