Sentence,Label
"The clotting cascade begins with the injury to a blood vessel.  This damage exposes blood platelets and vessel walls to the blood, initiating the process.",Causal
"When platelets adhere to the damaged vessel, they aggregate and form a plug.  This plug helps to seal the break and prevent further blood loss.",Sequential
"Fibrinogen, a clotting factor, then converts to fibrin.  Fibrin forms a meshwork that stabilizes the platelet plug, creating a stable clot.",Sequential
Factor XII activates the clotting cascade.  This activation triggers a series of enzymatic reactions.,Causal
"Calcium ions are essential for the activation of clotting factors.  They bind to these factors, making them active and able to catalyze further reactions.",Explanation
Anticoagulants like heparin inhibit factor XII and calcium binding.  This prevents excessive clotting and maintains blood fluidity.,Contrast
Tissue factor (TF) plays a crucial role by activating factor VII.  This step is crucial for the initiation of the intrinsic pathway.,Causal
The presence of thrombomodulin converts factor X to its active form.  This conversion is necessary for the conversion of prothrombin to thrombin.,Causal
"Thrombin then converts fibrinogen to fibrin.  This forms the clot matrix, securing the platelet plug.",Causal
The clotting cascade is tightly regulated to prevent unnecessary clot formation.  This regulation involves,Explanation
