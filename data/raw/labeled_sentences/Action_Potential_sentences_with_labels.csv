Sentence,Label
An action potential is generated when the membrane potential of a neuron reaches a threshold value.,Definition
The threshold is the voltage level at which the neuron's voltage-gated sodium channels open.,Explanation
"Once the membrane is repolarized, it cannot generate another action potential immediately, a period known as the refractory period.",Explanation
The action potential then propagates down the axon due to the electrical gradient and myelin sheath.,Sequential
"Myelin, a fatty substance, insulates the axon, increasing the speed of action potential conduction.",Addition
"Without myelin, action potentials would travel much slower.",Comparison
The action potential is an all-or-nothing event; it either occurs fully or not at all.,Definition
This ensures a consistent signal strength as the potential travels along the neuron.,Explanation
The generation and propagation of action potentials are crucial for neural communication.,Purpose
Understanding these processes is key to comprehending how neurons function in the nervous system.,Explanation
