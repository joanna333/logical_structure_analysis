"When body temperature rises, the hypothalamus activates mechanisms to cool down the body.",Causal
"One way to cool down is by increasing sweat production, which cools the skin as it evaporates.",Explanation
"Another mechanism is vasodilation, where blood vessels near the skin expand to allow more heat to escape.",Explanation
Shivering and non-shivering thermogenesis are examples of heat production processes.,Definition
"Brown adipose tissue is particularly effective at generating heat without shivering, using uncoupling proteins.",Explanation
"In contrast, regular adipose tissue stores energy but does not produce heat directly.",Contrast
"When the environment is cold, the body conserves heat by reducing non-essential movements and slowing down metabolism.",Causal
These physiological responses collectively maintain the body's core temperature within a narrow range.,Generalization
Understanding these mechanisms is crucial for treating conditions like hypothermia and hyperthermia.,Purpose
