Sentence,Label
Neurons communicate with each other through a process called synaptic transmission.,Definition
The first step in this process is the generation of an action potential in the presynaptic neuron.,Causal
This action potential travels down the axon and triggers the release of neurotransmitters.,Causal
Neurotransmitters are stored in vesicles within the axon terminal.,Definition
"When the action potential reaches the axon terminal, calcium ions enter the cell.",Causal
"The influx of calcium ions causes the vesicles to fuse with the membrane, releasing the neurotransmitters into the synaptic cleft.",Causal
The neurotransmitters then bind to receptors on the postsynaptic neuron.,Causal
"This binding can either excite or inhibit the postsynaptic neuron, depending on the type of neurotransmitter and receptor.",Explanation
"After the neurotransmitters have exerted their effect, they are either reabsorbed by the presynaptic neuron or broken down by enzymes in the synaptic cleft.",Causal
"This process ensures that neurotransmitter action is brief and localized, allowing precise control over neuronal communication.",Explanation
"Synaptic transmission is fundamental for all neural activities, enabling complex behaviors and thought processes.",Generalization
Understanding these mechanisms is crucial for comprehending how the brain functions and how neural communication can be affected by various factors.,Explanation
