"Ischemia occurs when blood flow to a tissue or organ is restricted, leading to a lack of oxygen and nutrients.",Definition
"Reperfusion injury happens when blood flow is restored after a period of ischemia, causing further cellular damage.",Definition
"Therefore, managing reperfusion injury is crucial to minimize the overall damage caused by ischemia.",Explanation
"In summary, ischemia deprives tissues of oxygen, leading to cellular damage, and reperfusion injury exacerbates this damage through additional mechanisms.",Summary
