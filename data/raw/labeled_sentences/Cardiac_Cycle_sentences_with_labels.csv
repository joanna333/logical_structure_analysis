Sentence,Label
The cardiac cycle is a sequence of events that describe the mechanical and electrical activities of the heart.,Definition
"The heart contracts in a specific order, starting with the atria and followed by the ventricles.",Sequential
Electrical conduction is essential for coordinating these contractions.,Causal
"The sinoatrial node (SA node) initiates the electrical impulse, which travels through the atrioventricular node (AV node) and into the ventricles.",Explanation
"When the electrical signal reaches the ventricles, they contract, pumping blood into the circulatory system.",Sequential
The dependency between electrical conduction and mechanical contraction ensures efficient cardiac output.,Causal
"Cardiac output is the amount of blood ejected by the heart in one minute, and it depends on both the heart rate and stroke volume.",Definition
"Therefore, maintaining proper electrical conduction is crucial for maintaining a healthy cardiac cycle and adequate cardiac output.",Explanation
"In summary, the cardiac cycle is a complex interaction between electrical signals and mechanical contractions, all of which are vital for the heart's ability to pump blood effectively.",Summary
