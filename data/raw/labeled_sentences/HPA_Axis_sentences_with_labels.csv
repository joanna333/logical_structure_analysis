The HPA axis is essential for maintaining homeostasis during stressful situations.,Explanation
"Under chronic stress, prolonged activation of the HPA axis can lead to adverse health effects, such as anxiety, depression, and cardiovascular issues.",Explanation
Understanding the HPA axis is vital for comprehending how the body manages stress and potential health implications.,Explanation
