Sentence,Label
The kidneys play a crucial role in renal compensation for acid-base imbalances such as acidosis and alkalosis.,Definition
"In contrast, during alkalosis, the kidneys conserve hydrogen ions and excrete bicarbonate to lower the blood's pH.",Contrast
These adjustments are part of the body's homeostatic mechanisms to maintain a narrow pH range.,Explanation
The kidneys' ability to compensate for acid-base imbalances is essential for survival.,Emphasis
"However, if the kidneys cannot compensate adequately, other organs may become involved to correct the pH.",Addition
Understanding these mechanisms is vital for diagnosing and treating acid-base disorders effectively.,Purpose
"In summary, the kidneys adjust the excretion and reabsorption of hydrogen ions and bicarbonate to correct pH imbalances, whether the condition is acidosis or alkalosis.",Summary
"In cases where renal compensation fails, other compensatory mechanisms must be considered.",Generalization
The relationship between the kidneys and acid-base balance is a prime example of homeostasis in action.,Explanation
"Each mechanism has a specific role, and the interplay between them ensures the body's pH remains stable.",Addition
