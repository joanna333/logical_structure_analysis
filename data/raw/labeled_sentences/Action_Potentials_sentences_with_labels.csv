Sentence,Label
Neurons generate action potentials when the voltage across their membrane reaches a threshold.,Definition
"Once an action potential starts, it cannot be stopped or reversed; this is known as the all-or-none principle.",Definition
"The action potential moves along the axon because of the rapid change in membrane potential, which triggers sodium channel opening in adjacent segments.",Explanation
Action potentials are essential for neurons to communicate with each other.,Purpose
"Without action potentials, neurons could not transmit information effectively to other cells.",Concession
The generation and propagation of action potentials are crucial for the functioning of the nervous system.,Generalization
"Despite being electrical in nature, action potentials are not affected by the electrical resistance of the extracellular space.",Clarification
"The action potential ends when the sodium channels close and potassium channels open, leading to repolarization.",Explanation
This process ensures that the electrical signal is transmitted accurately and rapidly from one part of the neuron to another.,Purpose
Understanding action potentials is key to comprehending how neurons function and communicate.,Generalization
