"At the capillary level, exchange of gases occurs  through diffusion. Oxygen moves from the bloodstream into the tissues, while carbon dioxide moves from the tissues into the blood -[Cause and Effect]-. This exchange is crucial for cellular respiration.",Definition
"Nutrients are also exchanged at the capillary level , passing from the blood into the tissues. This process is facilitated by the pressure gradient and the selective permeability of the capillary walls.",Definition
"The structure of capillaries, with their thin walls and wide surface area, , optimizes the exchange of these substances.",Explanation
"Capillaries are vital for these exchanges because they are  the site of most nutrient, gas, and waste transfer between blood and tissues.",Generalization
"Despite their small size, capillaries play a  critical role in the body's ability to efficiently exchange gases, nutrients, and waste products.",Emphasis
"Understanding how gases, nutrients, and waste are exchanged at the capillary level  helps explain why capillaries are essential for maintaining bodily functions.",Purpose
This exchange is a complex process that  relies on the differences in partial pressures and the selective permeability of the capillary walls.,Clarification
"In summary, at the capillary level, gases are exchanged through diffusion, nutrients pass from the blood into tissues, and waste products move from tissues into the blood . This exchange is",Summary
