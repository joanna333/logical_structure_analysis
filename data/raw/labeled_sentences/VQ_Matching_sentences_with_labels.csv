Sentence,Label
Ventilation-perfusion matching in the lungs is crucial for efficient gas exchange.,Definition
"This mismatch can occur due to various factors, such as lung diseases or physical obstruction.",Explanation
"When ventilation is low, not enough oxygen reaches the alveoli, and carbon dioxide cannot be expelled effectively.",Explanation
"Conversely, if perfusion is reduced, blood flow to the alveoli is insufficient, leading to poor gas exchange.",Explanation
Maintaining proper ventilation and perfusion is essential for healthy lung function.,Generalization
Understanding ventilation-perfusion matching helps in diagnosing and treating respiratory issues.,Purpose
"In summary, ventilation-perfusion matching is vital for gas exchange, and mismatches can lead to serious health complications.",Summary
