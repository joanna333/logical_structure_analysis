"The autonomic nervous system influences these changes, responding to light exposure and adjusting the pupil size accordingly.",Explanation
"Pupil constriction and dilation are involuntary actions, controlled by the brain to optimize vision.",Explanation
These processes are crucial for maintaining clear vision under varying light conditions.,Explanation
Understanding these mechanisms helps in diagnosing eye disorders that affect pupil function.,Purpose
"Thus, light sensitivity and the autonomic nervous system work together to adjust pupil size for optimal vision.",Addition
