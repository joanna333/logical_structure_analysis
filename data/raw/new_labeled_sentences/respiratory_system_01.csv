"The respiratory system is the bodily system that enables breathing and gas exchange.",Definition  
"It facilitates the intake of oxygen and the expulsion of carbon dioxide.",Explanation  
"When you inhale, air enters through the nose or mouth, causing the diaphragm to contract.",Causal  
"If the air is polluted, the respiratory system may be adversely affected.",Conditional  
"First, air enters the nasal cavity, then moves through the pharynx, larynx, trachea, bronchi, and finally into the alveoli.",Sequential  
"Unlike the digestive system, which breaks down food, the respiratory system processes air.",Comparison  
"Moreover, the respiratory system helps regulate the body's pH through carbon dioxide excretion.",Addition  
"The lungs are vital organs in the respiratory system, playing a crucial role in gas exchange.",Emphasis  
"The process of gas exchange occurs in the alveoli, tiny air sacs in the lungs, where oxygen is transferred to the blood and carbon dioxide is removed.",Elaboration  
"For instance, asthma is a condition that affects the respiratory system by narrowing the airways.",Illustration  
"Although the respiratory system is robust, it can be compromised by infections like pneumonia.",Concession  
"Generally, the respiratory system is essential for sustaining life by providing oxygen to the body.",Generalization  
"Since smoking damages the lungs, it can lead to chronic respiratory diseases.",Inference  
"In summary, the respiratory system is a complex network of organs and tissues that enable breathing and gas exchange.",Summary  
"To address respiratory issues, one can quit smoking and avoid polluted environments.",Problem Solution  
"While the heart pumps blood, the lungs facilitate gas exchange.",Contrastive Emphasis  
"The primary purpose of the respiratory system is to supply oxygen to the body and remove carbon dioxide.",Purpose  
"When we breathe out, we expel carbon dioxide, not oxygen.",Clarification  
"The main components of the respiratory system include the nose, pharynx, larynx, trachea, bronchi, and lungs.",Enumeration  
"Because of air pollution, many people suffer from respiratory problems.",Cause and Effect  
"During inhalation, the diaphragm contracts, expanding the chest cavity and drawing air into the lungs.",Temporal Sequence  
"The respiratory system not only aids in breathing but also contributes to speech production.",Addition  
"Even though the respiratory system is efficient, it can be affected by allergens and irritants.",Concession  
"The exchange of gases in the respiratory system is vital for maintaining cellular function.",Explanation  
"If you have a respiratory infection, it can lead to difficulties in breathing.",Conditional  
"Before air reaches the alveoli, it is filtered, warmed, and humidified.",Sequential  
"Compared to other systems, the respiratory system has a direct interface with the environment.",Comparison  
"Furthermore, the respiratory system works in conjunction with the circulatory system to distribute oxygen.",Addition  
"The role of the diaphragm is critical in the respiratory process.",Emphasis  
"The respiratory system's efficiency decreases with age due to various factors.",Generalization  
"If one has chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, breathing becomes increasingly difficult.",Conditional  
"After air enters the alveoli, oxygen diffuses into the blood capillaries.",Sequential  
"Despite its importance, the respiratory system is often taken for granted.",Concession  
"The respiratory system is not only for breathing but also for regulating blood pH.",Addition  
"In cases of emphysema, the alveoli are damaged, reducing gas exchange efficiency.",Illustration  
"Generally, maintaining good respiratory health involves regular exercise and avoiding smoke.",Generalization  
"Since the respiratory system is sensitive, it can be easily affected by environmental changes.",Inference  
"To improve respiratory health, one should practice deep breathing exercises.",Problem Solution  
"While the skin breathes through pores, the lungs are the primary respiratory organs.",Contrastive Emphasis  
"The main purpose of the respiratory system is to ensure adequate oxygen supply to tissues.",Purpose

"The respiratory system includes both upper and lower respiratory tracts.",Enumeration  
"Because of its exposure to the external environment, the respiratory system is prone to infections.",Cause and Effect  
"During physical activity, the respiratory rate increases to meet oxygen demands.",Temporal Sequence  
"The respiratory system's structure allows for efficient gas exchange at the alveolar level.",Explanation  
"If you live in a polluted area, you are at higher risk for respiratory diseases.",Conditional  
"Before air reaches the lungs, it is cleaned by nasal hairs and mucus.",Sequential  
"Despite its complexity, the respiratory system operates seamlessly under normal conditions.",Concession  
"The respiratory system's function is to maintain oxygen and carbon dioxide levels in the blood.",Explanation
