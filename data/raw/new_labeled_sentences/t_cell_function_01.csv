"T-cells are a type of white blood cell that plays a crucial role in the immune system.", "Definition"  
"T-cells are responsible for identifying and eliminating pathogens within the body.", "Explanation"  
"When T-cells recognize a foreign antigen, they activate and proliferate to mount an immune response.", "Conditional"  
"The process by which T-cells detect and attack infected cells is highly specific and targeted.", "Elaboration"  
"T-cells can be classified into several types, including helper T-cells, killer T-cells, and regulatory T-cells, each with distinct functions.", "Enumeration"  
"Helper T-cells, for example, coordinate the immune response by signaling to other immune cells.", "Illustration"  
"Killer T-cells, on the other hand, directly attack and destroy infected or cancerous cells.", "Contrast"  
"Regulatory T-cells play a critical role in preventing autoimmune diseases by suppressing excessive immune responses.", "Purpose"  
"Without T-cells, the immune system would be unable to effectively combat infections and diseases.", "Concession"  
"T-cells are essential for maintaining immune memory, which allows the body to quickly respond to previously encountered pathogens.", "Emphasis"  
"The immune memory provided by T-cells is the basis for vaccines, which train the immune system to recognize specific pathogens.", "Clarification"  
"T-cells communicate with other immune cells through the secretion of cytokines, which are signaling molecules.", "Explanation"  
"Cytokines help to coordinate the immune response by directing other cells to the site of infection.", "Elaboration"  
"If T-cells are compromised, as in the case of HIV infection, the immune system becomes severely weakened.", "Cause and Effect"  
"In cancer, T-cells can recognize and attack tumor cells, which is why immunotherapy is a promising treatment approach.", "Illustration"  
"T-cells undergo a rigorous selection process in the thymus to ensure they only target foreign antigens and not the body's own tissues.", "Sequential"  
"This selection process is crucial for preventing autoimmunity, where the immune system attacks the body's own cells.", "Purpose"  
"Despite their protective role, T-cells can sometimes mistakenly target healthy tissues, leading to autoimmune diseases.", "Concession"  
"The function of T-cells is comparable to that of soldiers in an army, each with a specific role in defending the body.", "Comparison"  
"Like soldiers, T-cells are trained, deployed, and coordinated to fight off invaders.", "Illustration"  
"T-cells are more specialized than other immune cells, such as B-cells, which produce antibodies.", "Contrast"  
"However, T-cells and B-cells work together to provide a comprehensive immune response.", "Addition"  
"The activation of T-cells is a complex process that involves multiple steps and interactions.", "Generalization"  
"Once activated, T-cells can proliferate rapidly to increase their numbers and effectively combat the threat.", "Sequential"  
"The effectiveness of T-cells in fighting infections can be influenced by factors such as age, stress, and overall health.", "Causal"  
"In elderly individuals, the function of T-cells may decline, leading to a weakened immune response.", "Inference"  
"Despite their many functions, T-cells are just one component of the intricate immune system.", "Contrastive Emphasis"  
"Understanding the function of T-cells is crucial for developing new treatments for immune-related diseases.", "Summary"  
"By enhancing T-cell function, immunotherapies can help the body fight off cancer more effectively.", "Problem Solution"  
"Overall, T-cells are indispensable for maintaining health and protecting the body from a wide range of threats.", "Generalization"
"Sentences","Labels"
"T cells are lymphocytes that play a crucial role in the adaptive immune system.","Definition"
"If pathogens invade the body, T cells are activated to respond.","Conditional"
"First, T cells recognize antigens, then they proliferate, and finally they carry out immune functions.","Sequential"
"Helper T cells assist other immune cells, whereas cytotoxic T cells destroy infected cells.","Comparison"
"They recognize specific antigens because they have unique receptors on their surfaces.","Explanation"
"Unlike B cells that produce antibodies, T cells directly attack infected cells.","Contrast"
"T cells help regulate immune responses and also aid in memory formation.","Addition"
"Proper functioning of T cells is vital for immune defense.","Emphasis"
"These cells undergo maturation in the thymus to develop their specific functions.","Elaboration"
"For example, regulatory T cells suppress overactive immune responses.","Illustration"
"Even though T cells are essential, their overactivation can lead to autoimmune diseases.","Concession"
"Most T cells require antigen presentation to become fully activated.","Generalization"
"Based on the antigens they encounter, T cells differentiate into various subtypes.","Inference"
"In summary, T cells are key players in targeting and eliminating pathogens.","Summary"
"To combat infections, enhancing T-cell responses can be an effective strategy.","Problem Solution"
"Rather than acting alone, T cells interact with other immune cells for a coordinated response.","Contrastive Emphasis"
"The purpose of memory T cells is to provide long-lasting immunity.","Purpose"
"In other words, T cells are the body's soldiers against specific threats.","Clarification"
"T-cell functions include activation, proliferation, differentiation, and cytokine production.","Enumeration"
"Activation of T cells leads to the release of signaling molecules that amplify the immune response.","Cause and Effect"
"As an infection progresses, T cells multiply to increase their defensive capabilities.","Temporal Sequence"
"They mature in the thymus where they learn to distinguish self from non-self.","Explanation"
"Naive T cells circulate until they encounter their specific antigen.","Definition"
"Failure to regulate T-cell activity can result in immune disorders.","Cause and Effect"
