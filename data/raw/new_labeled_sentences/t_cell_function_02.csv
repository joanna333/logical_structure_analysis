Label,Sentence
"Causal","T-cells are activated when they recognize specific antigens on the surface of infected cells."
"Conditional","If T-cells recognize a foreign antigen, they proliferate."
"Sequential","First, T-cells mature in the thymus; second, they circulate in the body; third, they encounter and bind to antigens presented by other immune cells."
"Comparison","Unlike B-cells, T-cells do not produce antibodies but instead directly attack infected cells."
"Explanation","T-cells play a crucial role in cell-mediated immunity."
"Definition","A T-cell is a type of lymphocyte that matures in the thymus."
"Contrast","Unlike B-cells, T-cells do not originate in the bone marrow."
"Addition","Moreover, T-cells can further be divided into different subsets, each with distinct functions."
"Emphasis","It is important to emphasize that T-cells are essential for the adaptive immune response."
"Elaboration","Elaborating on their function, T-cells can either directly kill infected cells or help other immune cells."
"Illustration","Imagine T-cells as the 'soldiers' that directly engage and eliminate enemy cells."
"Concession","Concessions must be made, however, that T-cells can sometimes mistakenly attack healthy cells."
"Generalization","Generally speaking, T-cells are versatile and crucial to immune defense."
"Inference","From their ability to specifically target infected cells, it can be inferred that T-cells are precise in their actions."
"Summary","In summary, T-cells function to seek out and destroy infected cells."
"Problem Solution","The problem of infected cells evading other immune responses is solved by the T-cell's direct action."
"Contrastive Emphasis","Contrastively, while B-cells produce antibodies, T-cells engage pathogens directly."
"Purpose","The purpose of T-cells is to mount an effective defense against intracellular threats."
"Clarification","To clarify, T-cells do not recognize free-floating antigens but require them to be presented."
"Enumeration","First, cytotoxic T-cells kill infected cells. Second, helper T-cells assist other immune cells. Third, regulatory T-cells maintain immune system balance."
"Cause and Effect","The presentation of specific antigens on infected cells causes T-cells to proliferate and attack."
"Temporal Sequence","Initially, T-cells scan for foreign substances; subsequently, they engage and eliminate infected cells if necessary."
"Causal","Activation of T-cells is triggered by the presence of specific antigens on the surface of host cells."
"Conditional","Should T-cells encounter their specific antigen, they undergo activation and proliferation."
"Sequential","T-cells leave the thymus, circulate through the body, and once an antigen is recognized, bind and respond."
"Comparison","Different from B-cells that secrete antibodies, T-cells engage directly with infected cells."
"Explanation","The function of T-cells involves recognizing and eliminating cells that have been infected by pathogens."
"Definition","A T-cell is defined as a type of lymphocyte that is of crucial importance to the immune system."
"Contrast","In contrast to innate immunity, T-cells provide a more targeted and specific immune response."
"Addition","Adding to their function, T-cells also play a role in regulating and modulating the immune response."
"Emphasis","It is important to emphasize the specificity and precision with which T-cells operate."
"Elaboration","Elaborating on this function, T-cells can differentiate into various subtypes, each with specialized functions."
"Illustration","Think of T-cells as guards that patrol the body and directly apprehend and neutralize infected cells."
"Concession","Yet, it is conceded that T-cells can sometimes be implicated in autoimmune diseases."
"Generalization","T-cells can be generally described as the elite force within the immune system."
"Inference","Based on their ability to recognize and destroy infected cells, one can infer that T-cells are key to preventing disease spread."
"Summary","T-cells, through their various functions, ensure the body maintains defense against pathogens."
