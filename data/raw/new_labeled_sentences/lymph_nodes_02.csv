"Causal","Lymph nodes function to filter out harmful substances like bacteria and cancer cells from lymph, thus protecting the body."
"Conditional","If lymph nodes function properly, they can effectively combat infections and diseases."
"Sequential","First, lymph fluid enters the lymph node, then passes through lymphocytes for inspection, and finally exits after being filtered."
"Comparison","Unlike the liver, which filters blood, lymph nodes filter lymphatic fluid."
"Explanation","Lymph nodes serve as a crucial component of the immune system, acting as a checkpoint for lymph."
"Definition","A lymph node is a small, bean-shaped organ that plays a key role in the immune response."
"Contrast","While bone marrow produces white blood cells, lymph nodes are where these cells encounter and deal with pathogens."
"Addition","Moreover, lymph nodes contain other immune system cells that aid in recognizing and neutralizing threats."
"Emphasis","Emphasizing their importance, lymph nodes are often a focal point in diseases like lymphoma."
"Elaboration","Lymph nodes elaborate on the immune system's role by providing a place for immune cells to interact with antigens."
"Illustration","Picture lymph nodes as security checkpoints for the body's lymphatic fluid, inspecting and removing invaders."
"Concession","Concessions must be made that sometimes, lymph nodes can swell due to infection or illness."
"Generalization","In general, lymph nodes are vital for maintaining the balance of the immune system."
"Inference","It can be inferred that if lymph nodes did not function, we would be more susceptible to infections."
"Summary","To summarize, lymph nodes are critical for filtering lymph and supporting the immune system."
"Problem Solution","The problem of pathogens in lymph is solved by the filtration process within lymph nodes."
"Contrastive Emphasis","Contrastively, other body systems, like the circulatory system, do not filter fluids in the same manner."
"Purpose","The purpose of lymph nodes is to purify lymph and support the body's immune defense."
"Clarification","Clarifying their function, lymph nodes act as a purification station for the lymphatic system."
"Enumeration","Enumerating their duties, lymph nodes identify, attack, and remove pathogens from lymph."
"Cause and Effect","The presence of pathogens in the lymph can cause lymph nodes to swell as they activate to fight off infection."
"Temporal Sequence","Initially, lymph enters the node, then pathogens are targeted, finally, filtered lymph exits."
"Causal","When harmful substances enter the lymph, lymph nodes become enlarged as they respond."
"Conditional","Should lymph nodes fail, the body may struggle to fight infections effectively."
"Sequential","Fluid flows into the lymph node, it is processed, and then exits, each step critical."
"Explanation","The immune system relies on lymph nodes to explain the presence of harmful substances and to neutralize them."
"Definition","Lymph nodes, by definition, are essential for the immune system's function."
"Contrast","Unlike skin, which provides a physical barrier, lymph nodes offer a chemical defense against invaders."
"Addition","Also, lymph nodes produce antibodies which are vital for long-term immunity."
"Emphasis","It is emphasized that without lymph nodes, our ability to combat diseases would be greatly diminished."
"Elaboration","Elaborating on their role, lymph nodes not only filter lymph but also facilitate immune responses."
"Illustration","Imagine lymph nodes as a network of security posts in the body, each scanning and neutralizing threats."
"Concession","Concessions must be made that sometimes, lymph nodes can swell and become painful."
"Generalization","In a general sense, the health of lymph nodes is indicative of the body's immune status."
"Inference","It can be inferred from this that regular lymph node function is necessary for overall health."
"Summary","Therefore, lymph node function is summarized as a pivotal process in the immune response to pathogens."
