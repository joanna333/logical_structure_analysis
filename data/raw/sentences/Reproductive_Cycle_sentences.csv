"The female reproductive cycle is regulated by hormones, which play a crucial role in controlling the events of the menstrual cycle"
"During the follicular phase, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) stimulates the growth of follicles in the ovary, preparing an egg for release"
Ovulation occurs when a surge of luteinizing hormone (LH) triggers the release of the mature egg from the ovary
"After ovulation, the empty follicle transforms into a corpus luteum, which secretes progesterone and estrogen, preparing the uterine lining for potential pregnancy"
"If pregnancy does not occur, the corpus luteum degenerates, leading to a drop in progesterone levels, which triggers menstruation"
"The luteal phase is characterized by the production of progesterone, which thickens the uterine lining to support a potential pregnancy"
"In contrast, the follicular phase is focused on follicle development and the buildup of the uterine lining"
"These hormonal changes are sequential, with each phase leading into the next, forming a continuous cycle"
Understanding these hormonal regulations is essential for comprehending how the female reproductive system functions
"Each phase is vital for the proper functioning of the cycle, ensuring the potential for reproduction while maintaining the health of the reproductive system"
