The brain has high metabolic needs - it consumes about 20% of the body's total energy despite making up only 2% of its mass
"To meet these needs, the brain relies on glucose as its primary energy source"
Glucose is transported through the bloodstream to the brain
"The blood-brain barrier ensures that only certain substances, like glucose, can enter the brain"
"When glucose levels drop, the brain cannot function properly, leading to symptoms like confusion and dizziness"
"To maintain a constant supply, the body regulates blood glucose levels through hormones like insulin and glucagon"
"In the absence of glucose, the brain can use ketones as an alternative energy source, a process known as ketosis"
"However, this is not a preferred or sustainable long-term solution for brain energy needs"
"Therefore, a balanced diet and regular meals are crucial to support brain function"
Understanding these metabolic needs helps in devising strategies for maintaining brain health
"In summary, the brain's high energy demands are met through a complex system involving glucose and, in emergencies, ketones, highlighting the importance of nutrition"
