Gestational diabetes occurs when a woman without pre-existing diabetes develops high blood sugar levels during pregnancy
The physiological basis involves the body's inability to produce enough insulin to meet the increased demands of pregnancy
"Insulin is crucial as it helps cells absorb glucose for energy, and its deficiency leads to elevated blood sugar levels"
"Complications can include larger than average babies, which may lead to delivery difficulties"
"Additionally, the baby might have low blood sugar immediately after birth, a condition known as hypoglycemia"
Mothers with gestational diabetes have an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes later in life
"Furthermore, gestational diabetes can lead to pre-eclampsia, a condition characterized by high blood pressure and protein in the urine"
Managing gestational diabetes is crucial to prevent these complications and ensure a healthy pregnancy and baby
Regular monitoring of blood sugar levels and dietary adjustments are often recommended to control the condition
"Despite these measures, some women may still experience complications, underscoring the importance of close medical supervision"
"In summary, gestational diabetes involves the body's insulin resistance during pregnancy, leading to various complications for both mother and baby"
