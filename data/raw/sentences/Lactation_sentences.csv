Lactation is the process of producing and secreting milk by the mammary glands
The pituitary gland plays a crucial role in the physiology of lactation
Oxytocin and prolactin are the primary hormones involved in lactation
Prolactin stimulates the mammary glands to produce milk
"Oxytocin, on the other hand, facilitates milk ejection during nursing"
The release of these hormones is triggered by the suckling of the infant
"When a baby suckles, it sends a signal to the brain to release prolactin and oxytocin"
Prolactin levels increase during pregnancy and remain high after childbirth to prepare the body for lactation
"Oxytocin levels surge during milk letdown, which is essential for feeding the newborn"
"If lactation is not properly initiated, hormonal imbalances can occur"
Breastfeeding is encouraged as it naturally regulates these hormonal processes
Understanding these hormonal controls is vital for ensuring successful lactation
"Without the proper hormonal balance, milk production may be insufficient"
"Therefore, the hormonal control of lactation is a complex yet essential process"
"Each hormone has a specific function, and their coordination is necessary for lactation to occur"
The physiological process of lactation is intricately linked to hormonal regulation
