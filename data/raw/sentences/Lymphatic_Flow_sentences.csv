"The lymphatic system is a crucial part of the circulatory system, primarily responsible for fluid balance and immune function"
"Lymphatic flow is driven by the movement of muscles, which compress lymphatic vessels, pushing lymph towards the heart"
Fluid balance is maintained as lymphatic vessels collect excess interstitial fluid and return it to the bloodstream
The lymphatic system is essential for immune function because it carries lymphocytes and other immune cells throughout the body
"When the lymphatic flow is compromised, edema can occur due to the accumulation of fluids in the tissues"
"Lymph nodes filter lymph, trapping pathogens and cancer cells, thus playing a vital role in immune defense"
The relationship between lymphatic flow and immune function is such that a healthy flow ensures the efficient transport of immune cells to sites of infection or injury
"In contrast, a blocked or slowed lymphatic flow can lead to immune deficiencies and increased susceptibility to diseases"
"Understanding these mechanisms helps in diagnosing and treating lymphatic disorders, which can affect both fluid balance and immune response"
"In summary, lymphatic flow is vital for maintaining fluid balance and supporting immune function through the transportation of fluids and immune cells throughout the body"
