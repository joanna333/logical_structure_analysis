The complement system is a crucial part of the immune defense
"It is activated through several pathways, including the classical, lectin, and alternative pathways"
"Upon activation, the complement system enhances the ability of antibodies to bind to pathogens"
"This binding can lead to the opsonization of pathogens, marking them for destruction by phagocytes"
"Additionally, the system can directly induce cell lysis, killing the pathogen"
"The complement system also supports inflammation, attracting immune cells to the site of infection"
"In contrast, if not regulated properly, the system can cause damage to healthy cells"
"Overall, the complement system plays a vital role in eliminating pathogens and initiating immune responses"
Understanding its activation and roles is essential for comprehending immune defense mechanisms
