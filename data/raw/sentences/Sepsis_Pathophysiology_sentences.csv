"During sepsis, the body undergoes significant physiological changes"
These changes are triggered by an overwhelming immune response to an infection
"The immune system releases inflammatory cytokines, which can cause systemic effects"
"The blood vessels dilate, leading to decreased blood pressure, known as septic shock"
This dilation is intended to increase blood flow to vital organs but can lead to hypoperfusion
"The liver and kidneys may begin to fail, as they receive insufficient blood supply"
This failure can exacerbate the condition and complicate recovery
"Sepsis can lead to multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, where several organs stop functioning properly"
This is a severe consequence of the systemic inflammatory response
"Patients often experience fever and rapid breathing, symptoms of the body's attempt to fight the infection"
"However, these symptoms can quickly escalate into life-threatening conditions"
Early recognition and treatment are crucial to prevent sepsis from progressing to severe stages
"Prompt intervention can mitigate the physiological changes and systemic effects, improving survival rates"
