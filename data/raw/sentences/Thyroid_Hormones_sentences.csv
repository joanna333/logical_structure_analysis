Thyroid hormones play a crucial role in metabolism and energy regulation within the body
The primary hormones produced by the thyroid gland are triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4)
"These hormones increase the basal metabolic rate, influencing nearly every cell in the body"
The secretion of thyroid hormones is regulated by the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid (HPT) axis
"The hypothalamus releases thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH), which stimulates the pituitary gland to secrete thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH)"
TSH then prompts the thyroid gland to produce T3 and T4
"When thyroid hormone levels rise, a negative feedback loop is activated to inhibit further TSH release"
"This feedback loop ensures that thyroid hormone levels remain within a narrow, healthy range"
"If thyroid hormone levels drop too low, TRH production increases, leading to higher TSH levels and consequently, more thyroid hormone synthesis"
The sensitivity of target tissues to thyroid hormones can also be modulated by additional feedback loops at the cellular level
"For instance, high thyroid hormone concentrations can lead to increased receptor internalization, reducing the number of available receptors and thus, hormone sensitivity"
This mechanism helps maintain homeostasis even when systemic hormone levels are elevated
"In summary, the regulation of thyroid hormones is a complex system"
