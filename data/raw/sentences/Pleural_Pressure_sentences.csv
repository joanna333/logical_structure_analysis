Pleural pressure is a crucial factor in lung expansion and ventilation
Pleural pressure is the pressure difference between the pleural cavity and the atmosphere
Chest expansion increases pleural pressure in the lungs during inhalation
The increase in pleural pressure relative to atmospheric pressure helps expand the lungs
This lung expansion allows for air to flow into the respiratory passages
"Pleural pressure decreases during exhalation, facilitating the expulsion of air from the lungs"
The balance of pleural pressure is essential for maintaining lung volume and facilitating gas exchange
"Without pleural pressure, the lungs would collapse during exhalation, hindering ventilation"
"Thus, pleural pressure plays a vital role in the mechanics of breathing"
Understanding pleural pressure is key to comprehending how the lungs function properly
"In summary, pleural pressure is essential for lung expansion and ventilation, maintaining the necessary pressure differentials for breathing to occur"
