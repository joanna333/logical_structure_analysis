Insulin and glucagon are hormones crucial for maintaining blood glucose levels
Insulin is produced by the pancreas and helps cells absorb glucose from the blood
"When blood glucose levels rise, insulin is released to facilitate its entry into cells"
"Glucagon, on the other hand, is released when blood glucose levels are low"
It prompts the liver to convert stored glycogen into glucose and release it into the bloodstream
The interplay between insulin and glucagon ensures that blood glucose levels remain stable
"When insulin and glucagon work in balance, they prevent hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia"
"If insulin production is insufficient, glucagon's effects can lead to elevated blood glucose levels"
"Conversely, if glucagon is not adequately released, insulin's action might lead to low blood sugar"
The body's feedback system involving insulin and glucagon is essential for glucose homeostasis
Understanding this balance is key to managing diabetes effectively
"Thus, the coordinated release of insulin and glucagon is vital for maintaining normal blood glucose levels"
