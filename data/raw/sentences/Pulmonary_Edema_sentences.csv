"Pulmonary edema affects gas exchange by flooding the alveoli with fluid, making it difficult for oxygen to diffuse into the bloodstream and carbon dioxide to exit"
"Fluid in the lungs impairs the ability of the alveoli to expand properly, which is essential for efficient gas exchange"
"As a result, the lungs cannot adequately take in oxygen and expel carbon dioxide, leading to respiratory distress"
"Patients may experience shortness of breath and a feeling of suffocation, which are direct consequences of the compromised gas exchange"
"The heart's inability to pump effectively can also contribute to pulmonary edema, further complicating gas exchange"
"Without treatment, pulmonary edema can lead to hypoxia and potentially be life-threatening"
"Therefore, understanding the mechanisms of pulmonary edema is crucial for effective management and improving patient outcomes"
"In summary, pulmonary edema disrupts gas exchange by filling the lungs with fluid, causing a range of respiratory symptoms and potential severe health consequences"
