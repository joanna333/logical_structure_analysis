Gluconeogenesis is a metabolic pathway that occurs in the liver and kidneys
"This process generates glucose from non-carbohydrate sources such as lactate, glycerol, and certain amino acids"
"During fasting, the body's glucose stores, like glycogen, are depleted"
"To maintain blood sugar levels, the body needs to synthesize glucose"
Gluconeogenesis becomes crucial as it provides the necessary glucose for energy
"Without this process, the body would not be able to sustain glucose levels during fasting periods"
"Thus, gluconeogenesis plays a vital role in ensuring energy supply when dietary carbohydrates are unavailable"
