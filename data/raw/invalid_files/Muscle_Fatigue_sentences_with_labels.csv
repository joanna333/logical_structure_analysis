"Muscle fatigue occurs for several reasons -[Cause and Effect]-. One cause is prolonged physical activity, which leads to a depletion of energy sources in the muscles -[Cause and Effect]. Another cause is the buildup of metabolic byproducts such as lactic acid, which can interfere with muscle function -[Cause and Effect]. The physiological adaptations to muscle fatigue include increased blood flow to carry away waste products -[Cause and Effect]-. Muscles also experience changes in ion exchange across the cell membrane to maintain electrical potential -[Cause and Effect]. Additionally, there is an increase in the production of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to replenish energy stores -[Cause and Effect]. These adaptations help muscles continue to function despite fatigue .",Explanation
"Muscle fibers rely on a constant supply of oxygen and nutrients to sustain contraction . When these supplies are depleted, muscle fatigue sets in -[Cause and Effect]. The body responds by recruiting more muscle fibers and increasing the heart rate to enhance blood flow . This process, however, can only compensate for a certain period before fatigue becomes inevitable . Muscles also adapt by switching to anaerobic metabolism, which produces lactic acid as a byproduct . Lactic acid accumulation can lead to muscle burning and decreased muscle contractility -[Cause and Effect].",Definition
Muscle fatigue is not just a local phenomenon within the muscle but involves the nervous system as well . The central nervous system may limit muscle activation to prevent further damage . This protective mechanism is a form of negative feedback where the brain senses excessive fatigue and reduces neural drive to the muscles -[Cause and,Elaboration
