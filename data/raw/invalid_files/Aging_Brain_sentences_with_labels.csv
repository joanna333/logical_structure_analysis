"As people age, the brain undergoes physiological changes."
" These changes include a reduction in the volume of certain brain regions. "
The hippocampus, for instance, often shrinks with age, which can affect memory."
" Neurotransmitter levels also decline, impacting communication between neurons."
" These alterations can lead to cognitive decline, including memory loss and slower processing speed.",Causal
"The prefrontal cortex, important for executive functions like decision-making and planning, may thin."
" This can result in difficulties with attention and impulse control",-[Cause and Effect]
"Additionally, the cerebellum, which aids in coordination and motor control, can experience atrophy."
" This can lead to problems with balance and motor skills-[Cause and Effect].",Causal
"Moreover, the white matter in the brain, which facilitates communication between different brain regions, can become less efficient."
" This can slow down information processing",-[Cause and Effect]. 
"The myelin sheath, which insulates nerve fibers, can degrade, affecting the speed at which neural signals are transmitted.",Causal
"These physiological changes are not uniform across all individuals."
" Factors such as genetics, lifestyle, and overall health can influence the extent and rate of cognitive decline."
" Understanding these changes is crucial for developing strategies to mitigate cognitive decline.",Generalization
"In summary, aging brings about significant physiological changes in the brain that can lead to cognitive impairments."
" These include volume reductions, neurotransmitter changes, and structural",Summary
