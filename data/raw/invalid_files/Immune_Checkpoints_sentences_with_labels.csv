"Immune checkpoints play a crucial role in preventing autoimmunity by regulating the immune response.  Without these checkpoints, the immune system might mistakenly attack healthy cells, leading to autoimmunity. -[Cause and Effect]- Immune checkpoints act as brakes on the immune system, ensuring it targets only true threats.  When these checkpoints are malfunctioning, as seen in certain cancers, they can actually promote autoimmunity.  Normally, they prevent autoimmunity by controlling the intensity and specificity of the immune response.  For instance, PD-1 acts as a checkpoint that, when bound to PD-L1, signals the T cells to halt their attack, preventing self-damage.  This mechanism is essential for maintaining homeostasis within the body and preventing chronic inflammation.  In autoimmune diseases, these checkpoints can be dysregulated, allowing unchecked immune responses against the body's own tissues.  Therefore, understanding and potentially modulating these checkpoints are areas of active research in treating autoimmune conditions.  By doing so, scientists aim to restore the immune system's ability to distinguish between self and non-self effectively.  This careful regulation is vital to avoid the chaos of autoimmunity, where the body attacks its own cells.",Definition
