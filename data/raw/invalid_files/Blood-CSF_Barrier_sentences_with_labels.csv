"The blood-CSF barrier plays a crucial role in protecting the central nervous system.  This barrier prevents harmful substances in the bloodstream from entering the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and subsequently the brain and spinal cord.  By blocking the passage of certain molecules, the barrier shields the nervous tissue from potential damage and infection.  Without this protective mechanism, the delicate neural tissues would be vulnerable to a wide range of pathogens and toxins present in the blood.  Therefore, the blood-CSF barrier is essential for maintaining the integrity and functionality of the central nervous system.",Definition
