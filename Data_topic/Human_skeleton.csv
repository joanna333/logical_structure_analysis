"Bone marrow, located inside some bones, is responsible for producing blood cells, including red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets.",Explanation
"The human skeleton also acts as a storage site for essential minerals, such as calcium and phosphorus.",Purpose
"Joints, where bones meet, are classified as synovial, fibrous, or cartilaginous, depending on their structure and mobility.",Definition
"Synovial joints, such as the knee and elbow, allow for a wide range of motion due to the presence of synovial fluid.",Explanation
