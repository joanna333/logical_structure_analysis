"The human nervous system is a complex network of cells and tissues that transmit electrical signals throughout the body.","Definition"
"It is divided into two major parts: the central nervous system (CNS) and the peripheral nervous system (PNS).","Definition"
"The CNS consists of the brain and spinal cord, which control and coordinate the body’s functions.","Explanation"
"The PNS includes all other neural elements, such as sensory receptors, nerves, and ganglia, which connect the CNS to the body’s limbs and organs.","Explanation"
"The brain is the control center of the nervous system, processing information and regulating thought, memory, emotion, and movement.","Explanation"
"The spinal cord acts as a communication pathway between the brain and the rest of the body, transmitting motor and sensory signals.","Explanation"
"The somatic nervous system controls voluntary movements and sensations, while the autonomic nervous system regulates involuntary bodily functions.","Explanation"
"The autonomic nervous system is further divided into the sympathetic and parasympathetic systems, which control the body’s responses to stress and relaxation.","Explanation"
"Neurons are the functional units of the nervous system, transmitting electrical impulses across synapses to communicate with other neurons or target cells.","Definition"
"The nervous system uses neurotransmitters to send signals across synaptic gaps, with common examples being dopamine, serotonin, and acetylcholine.","Explanation"
"Reflexes, or rapid involuntary responses to stimuli, are mediated by the nervous system through spinal cord pathways without involving the brain.","Explanation"
"The brain itself is divided into regions, each responsible for specific functions, such as the cerebrum for higher functions and the cerebellum for motor coordination.","Explanation"
"The nervous system works closely with other systems, such as the endocrine system, to maintain homeostasis in the body.","Cause and Effect"
"Diseases of the nervous system, like Alzheimer’s disease or multiple sclerosis, can affect cognition, movement, and bodily functions.","Explanation"
"Neuroplasticity, the brain’s ability to reorganize itself by forming new neural connections, is a key feature of recovery after injury.","Explanation"
"Neurotransmitter imbalances are linked to several mental health conditions, including depression, anxiety, and schizophrenia.","Cause and Effect"
"Damage to the nervous system can have profound effects on an individual’s ability to move, perceive the environment, and think clearly.","Elaboration"
"Studying the nervous system provides critical insights into how behaviors, emotions, and cognition are influenced by biological processes.","Explanation"
"In conclusion, the nervous system is essential for coordinating and regulating all functions in the human body, both consciously and unconsciously.","Summary"
