"Alveoli are tiny air sacs found in the lungs that are responsible for gas exchange during respiration.","Definition"
"Each alveolus is surrounded by a network of capillaries where oxygen is absorbed into the blood, and carbon dioxide is released from the blood.","Explanation"
"The walls of the alveoli are made of a single layer of epithelial cells to allow efficient gas diffusion.","Explanation"
"The large surface area provided by the alveoli enables the lungs to exchange a significant amount of oxygen and carbon dioxide.","Explanation"
"Alveolar sacs are connected to each other through alveolar ducts, which help direct air into the alveolar space.","Explanation"
"The alveolar walls are covered by a surfactant, a substance that reduces surface tension and prevents the alveoli from collapsing.","Explanation"
"Alveolar damage, such as in emphysema, can reduce the lungs' ability to exchange gases, leading to respiratory difficulties.","Problem Solution"
"In chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), the destruction of alveolar walls causes impaired lung function.","Cause and Effect"
"Alveoli are also involved in maintaining the acid-base balance in the blood by exchanging carbon dioxide during respiration.","Explanation"
"The process of ventilation and perfusion, where air is brought into the alveoli and blood flows around them, is vital for effective gas exchange.","Explanation"
"During inspiration, the alveoli fill with air, while during expiration, the carbon dioxide is expelled from the lungs.","Explanation"
"Alveolar function is critical for overall lung health, and dysfunction can lead to conditions like pneumonia or pulmonary edema.","Explanation"
"Researchers are exploring therapies to regenerate damaged alveolar cells in order to treat conditions like fibrosis or emphysema.","Elaboration"
"In conclusion, alveoli are central to respiratory health, facilitating the exchange of gases necessary for cellular metabolism.","Summary"
