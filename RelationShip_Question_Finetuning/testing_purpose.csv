"The human heart is a muscular organ that pumps blood through the blood vessels by repeated, rhythmic contractions. The heart has four chambers: two atria (upper chambers) and two ventricles (lower chambers). Oxygen-poor blood enters the right atrium, is pumped into the right ventricle, and then flows to the lungs where it picks up oxygen. Oxygen-rich blood returns to the left atrium, is pumped into the left ventricle, and is then distributed to the rest of the body through the aorta.","What is the function of the left ventricle in the circulatory system?","It pumps oxygen-poor blood to the lungs.","It pumps oxygen-rich blood to the body.","It collects blood from the body.","It pumps blood into the right atrium.","It pumps oxygen-rich blood to the body."
"Type 1 diabetes is a chronic condition where the pancreas produces little or no insulin, a hormone that is required to regulate blood sugar levels. This condition occurs when the body's immune system attacks and destroys the insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas. People with type 1 diabetes must manage their condition by regularly checking their blood glucose levels and administering insulin injections.","Which of the following is most likely the cause of Type 1 diabetes?","Excessive intake of sugary foods.","An autoimmune response attacking insulin-producing cells.","Insulin resistance in body tissues.","Lack of exercise leading to weight gain.","An autoimmune response attacking insulin-producing cells."
"A stroke occurs when there is an interruption in the blood supply to part of the brain. This can be caused by a blocked artery (ischemic stroke) or by the rupture of an artery (hemorrhagic stroke). When blood flow is interrupted, brain cells in the affected area begin to die. The symptoms of a stroke can include weakness or numbness on one side of the body, trouble speaking, and loss of coordination.","Which of the following best describes an ischemic stroke?","It is caused by the rupture of a blood vessel in the brain.","It is caused by a blockage in the blood supply to the brain.","It results from brain cell death caused by high blood pressure.","It is a type of stroke that primarily affects the heart.","It is caused by a blockage in the blood supply to the brain."
"The immune system is a network of cells, tissues, and organs that work together to defend the body against harmful microorganisms such as bacteria, viruses, and fungi. It includes physical barriers like the skin, specialized cells like white blood cells, and organs such as the spleen and lymph nodes.

"Vaccination is one of the most effective ways to prevent infectious diseases. Vaccines stimulate the body's immune system to recognize and fight specific pathogens without causing the disease itself. Some vaccines are designed to provide lifelong immunity, while others may require booster shots to maintain protection. Routine vaccination schedules are recommended for children and adults to ensure optimal protection against various diseases.","What is the primary purpose of a vaccine?","To cure infectious diseases.","To strengthen the immune system against infections.","To eliminate pathogens from the body.","To reduce inflammation in the body.","To strengthen the immune system against infections."
"The liver is a vital organ in the human body that performs a wide range of functions, including detoxifying harmful substances, producing bile, storing nutrients, and regulating metabolism. It is located in the upper right side of the abdomen and has the unique ability to regenerate itself after injury or surgery. Liver diseases such as cirrhosis, hepatitis, and fatty liver disease can impair these functions, leading to serious health complications.","Which of the following is a function of the liver?","Detoxifying harmful substances.","Producing red blood cells.","Storing insulin.","Regulating blood pressure.","Detoxifying harmful substances."
"Anemia is a condition where the body lacks enough healthy red blood cells to carry adequate oxygen to its tissues. This condition can be caused by various factors, including nutritional deficiencies, chronic diseases, or genetic disorders. The symptoms of anemia often include fatigue, pale skin, and shortness of breath. Treatment depends on the underlying cause, but it may include iron supplements, dietary changes, or medication to address the root cause of the condition.","Which of the following is a common symptom of anemia?","Weight gain.","Difficulty breathing.","Increased appetite.","Blurred vision.","Difficulty breathing."
"Hypertension, also known as high blood pressure, is a condition where the force of the blood against the walls of the arteries is consistently too high. Over time, this can damage the heart and blood vessels, leading to serious health problems like heart disease, stroke, and kidney failure. Risk factors for hypertension include age, family history, obesity, lack of physical activity, and excessive alcohol consumption.","What is a primary risk factor for hypertension?","Being underweight.","Consuming large amounts of water.","Lack of physical activity.","Frequent deep breathing.","Lack of physical activity."
"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a progressive lung disease that causes difficulty in breathing. It is commonly caused by long-term exposure to harmful substances such as cigarette smoke. Symptoms of COPD include chronic cough, wheezing, shortness of breath, and increased mucus production. Although COPD is not curable, treatments such as bronchodilators, steroids, and lifestyle changes can help manage the symptoms.","Which of the following is a common cause of COPD?","Excessive alcohol consumption.","Long-term exposure to cigarette smoke.","Regular exercise.","Eating a high-protein diet.","Long-term exposure to cigarette smoke."
"Alzheimer's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that affects memory, thinking, and behavior. It is the most common cause of dementia in older adults. The exact cause of Alzheimer's disease is unknown, but it is believed to be related to a combination of genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors. Symptoms typically begin with mild memory loss and progress to more severe cognitive decline, eventually interfering with daily activities.","What is the most common cause of dementia in older adults?","Parkinson's disease","Alzheimer's disease","Huntington's disease","Multiple sclerosis","Alzheimer's disease"
"Asthma is a chronic disease that affects the airways in the lungs, causing them to become inflamed and narrowed, making it difficult to breathe. Common triggers for asthma attacks include allergens, respiratory infections, exercise, and cold air. Symptoms of asthma include wheezing, coughing, chest tightness, and shortness of breath. Although asthma cannot be cured, it can be managed with medications like inhalers and by avoiding triggers.","Which of the following is a common trigger for asthma attacks?","Exposure to sunlight","Exercise","Hearing loud noises","Eating large meals","Exercise"
"Type 2 diabetes is a metabolic disorder that affects the way the body processes blood sugar (glucose). It is characterized by insulin resistance, where the body does not use insulin effectively, and eventually, the pancreas cannot produce enough insulin to maintain normal blood sugar levels. This can lead to high blood sugar levels, which over time can cause damage to organs and tissues. Type 2 diabetes is often managed through lifestyle changes, such as diet and exercise, and medication when necessary.","Which of the following is a characteristic of Type 2 diabetes?","The body produces too much insulin.","The pancreas does not produce enough insulin.","Insulin is produced in excess but not used effectively.","The body is unable to absorb nutrients.","Insulin is produced in excess but not used effectively."
"Depression is a mood disorder that causes persistent feelings of sadness, hopelessness, and loss of interest in activities once enjoyed. It affects how a person feels, thinks, and behaves, and can interfere with daily functioning.

"Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a condition where the kidneys lose their ability to filter waste and excess fluids from the blood over time. It can be caused by conditions like diabetes, hypertension, or glomerulonephritis.

"Hypertension, also known as high blood pressure, is a common condition where the blood pressure in the arteries is persistently elevated. Over time, this can lead to serious health problems, such as heart disease, stroke, and kidney damage.

Managing blood pressure through medication and lifestyle changes can help reduce the risk of these complications.","What is a common consequence of untreated hypertension?","Improved circulation","Increased risk of heart disease","Faster metabolism","Increased energy","Increased risk of heart disease"
"Parkinson’s disease is a neurodegenerative disorder that affects movement.
