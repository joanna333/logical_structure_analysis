"The adrenal medulla is a small part of the adrenal gland located above the kidneys.", "Where is the adrenal medulla located?", "Above the kidneys", "Near the liver", "Next to the pancreas", "Inside the brain", "Above the kidneys"
"The primary function of the adrenal medulla is to release hormones, particularly epinephrine and norepinephrine, into the bloodstream.", "What is the primary function of the adrenal medulla?", "Regulate blood sugar", "Release hormones like epinephrine and norepinephrine", "Produce insulin", "Regulate body temperature", "Release hormones like epinephrine and norepinephrine"
"When the body perceives danger, the adrenal medulla is stimulated, leading to the release of epinephrine and norepinephrine.", "What triggers the release of epinephrine and norepinephrine from the adrenal medulla?", "Increased blood sugar levels", "Perception of danger", "Increase in body temperature", "Lack of sleep", "Perception of danger"
"The increase in these hormones accelerates heart rate, increases blood pressure, and directs blood flow to essential muscles, which are necessary for fighting or fleeing.", "What effects do the hormones released by the adrenal medulla have on the body?", "Slow down heart rate", "Accelerate heart rate, increase blood pressure, and direct blood flow to muscles", "Decrease blood pressure", "Enhance digestion", "Accelerate heart rate, increase blood pressure, and direct blood flow to muscles"
