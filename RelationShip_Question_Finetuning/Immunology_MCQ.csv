"Immunology is the study of the immune system and how it defends the body against harmful agents like pathogens, toxins, and cancer cells.","What does immunology study?","The immune system and its defense against harmful agents","The structure of bacteria","Human anatomy","The digestive system","The immune system and its defense against harmful agents"
"The immune system consists of organs, cells, and molecules that work together to protect the body from infections.","What does the immune system consist of?","Organs, cells, and molecules that protect the body from infections","Only white blood cells","Only antibodies","Only lymph nodes","Organs, cells, and molecules that protect the body from infections"
"Key components of the immune system include white blood cells, antibodies, lymph nodes, and the spleen.","Which of the following is a key component of the immune system?","White blood cells, antibodies, lymph nodes, and the spleen","Stomach acids","Red blood cells","Muscles","White blood cells, antibodies, lymph nodes, and the spleen"
"The immune system can be classified into innate immunity, which provides immediate defense, and adaptive immunity, which develops over time.","How is the immune system classified?","Innate immunity and adaptive immunity","Humoral immunity and cell-mediated immunity","Active immunity and passive immunity","Acquired immunity and natural immunity","Innate immunity and adaptive immunity"
"Innate immunity includes physical barriers like skin and mucous membranes, as well as cellular defenses like macrophages and neutrophils.","What does innate immunity include?","Physical barriers like skin and mucous membranes, and cellular defenses like macrophages and neutrophils","Only antibodies","Only T cells and B cells","Only physical barriers","Physical barriers like skin and mucous membranes, and cellular defenses like macrophages and neutrophils"
"Adaptive immunity involves specialized cells, such as T cells and B cells, that recognize and attack specific pathogens.","What cells are involved in adaptive immunity?","T cells and B cells","Neutrophils","Macrophages","Red blood cells","T cells and B cells"
"Immunological memory allows the body to respond more efficiently to subsequent infections by the same pathogen.","What does immunological memory do?","It helps the body respond more efficiently to subsequent infections by the same pathogen","It reduces the immune response to infections","It eliminates pathogens immediately","It prevents the body from developing any diseases","It helps the body respond more efficiently to subsequent infections by the same pathogen"
"The immune system is crucial in identifying and eliminating pathogens, preventing infections, and even detecting and destroying cancer cells.","What is the role of the immune system?","Identify and eliminate pathogens, prevent infections, and detect cancer cells","Produce antibodies only","Transport oxygen through the body","Regulate body temperature","Identify and eliminate pathogens, prevent infections, and detect cancer cells"
"Vaccination is a way of enhancing the adaptive immune system by introducing harmless antigens that trigger an immune response.","What does vaccination enhance?","The adaptive immune system by introducing harmless antigens","The body's physical barriers","The number of white blood cells","The innate immune system","The adaptive immune system by introducing harmless antigens"
"Immunodeficiencies, such as HIV/AIDS, occur when the immune system is weakened, making the body more susceptible to infections.","What happens in immunodeficiencies like HIV/AIDS?","The immune system is weakened, making the body more susceptible to infections","The body becomes resistant to infections","The immune system becomes overactive","The immune system is unaffected","The immune system is weakened, making the body more susceptible to infections"
"Autoimmune diseases, like rheumatoid arthritis and lupus, arise when the immune system mistakenly attacks the body’s own cells.","What causes autoimmune diseases?","The immune system mistakenly attacks the body’s own cells","The immune system is underactive","The body becomes hypersensitive to pathogens","The body’s defense mechanism becomes inefficient","The immune system mistakenly attacks the body’s own cells"
"In summary, immunology plays a crucial role in understanding how the body fights infections and manages diseases.","What is the role of immunology?","Understanding how the body fights infections and manages diseases","Only understanding how vaccines work","Only studying the structure of the immune system","Understanding only the innate immune system","Understanding how the body fights infections and manages diseases"
