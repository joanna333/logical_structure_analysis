Text,Question,Option A,Option B,Option C,Option D,Answer
"The human body employs several buffering systems to maintain pH balance, which is crucial for the proper functioning of cells and organs.", "What is the primary function of buffering systems in the human body?","To regulate body temperature","To maintain pH balance for proper cellular function","To produce energy for cells","To digest food","To maintain pH balance for proper cellular function"
"One of the key buffering systems is the bicarbonate buffer system.","Which buffering system is considered key in maintaining pH balance in the body?","Phosphate buffer system","Bicarbonate buffer system","Protein buffer system","Hydrogen ion buffer system","Bicarbonate buffer system"
"This system involves carbon dioxide (CO2), water (H2O), and bicarbonate ions (HCO3-).","Which of the following components are involved in the bicarbonate buffer system?","Oxygen (O2), sodium (Na+), potassium (K+)","Carbon dioxide (CO2), water (H2O), bicarbonate ions (HCO3-)","Nitrogen (N2), chloride (Cl-), phosphate ions (PO4-)","Water (H2O), glucose, calcium (Ca2+)","Carbon dioxide (CO2), water (H2O), bicarbonate ions (HCO3-)"
"The bicarbonate ions then bind with hydrogen ions, preventing a significant change in pH.","What role do bicarbonate ions play in regulating pH in the body?","They bind with oxygen to form carbonic acid","They bind with hydrogen ions to prevent pH changes","They break down excess acid","They release hydrogen ions to decrease pH","They bind with hydrogen ions to prevent pH changes"
"This binding action acts as a buffer, absorbing excess hydrogen ions and maintaining the body's pH within a narrow range.","What is the result of bicarbonate ions absorbing excess hydrogen ions?","It decreases the body's temperature","It maintains the body's pH within a narrow range","It increases metabolic activity","It enhances enzyme function","It maintains the body's pH within a narrow range"
"The bicarbonate buffer system is particularly important in the blood and extracellular fluid.","Where is the bicarbonate buffer system especially important in the body?","In the liver and muscles","In the blood and extracellular fluid","In the digestive system","In the bone marrow","In the blood and extracellular fluid"
"It helps regulate pH during periods of increased metabolic activity or when external acids are introduced.","When does the bicarbonate buffer system help regulate pH?","During periods of increased metabolic activity or external acid introduction","Only when blood sugar levels are high","During digestion","Only during exercise","During periods of increased metabolic activity or external acid introduction"
"Without effective buffering, even slight pH changes could be lethal to cells.","Why is effective buffering important in the body?","To prevent dehydration","To avoid dangerous pH changes that could be lethal to cells","To regulate body temperature","To enhance oxygen delivery to tissues","To avoid dangerous pH changes that could be lethal to cells"
"Therefore, the bicarbonate buffer system is vital for homeostasis in the human body.","Why is the bicarbonate buffer system considered vital for the human body?","It helps produce energy for cells","It is essential for maintaining homeostasis by regulating pH","It supports digestion and metabolism","It enhances protein synthesis","It is essential for maintaining homeostasis by regulating pH"
