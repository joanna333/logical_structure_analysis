Text,Question,Option A,Option B,Option C,Option D,Answer
"The human nose is located centrally on the face and is composed of both bone and cartilage.","What is the human nose composed of?","Bone and cartilage","Only cartilage","Only bone","Muscle and bone","Bone and cartilage"
"It serves as a primary organ for respiration, allowing air to enter and exit the body.","What is the primary function of the nose?","Respiration","Sense of taste","Speech production","Filtering air","Respiration"
"Air is filtered through the nostrils, where small hairs and mucus trap dust and other particles.","What helps filter air in the nose?","Small hairs and mucus","Bone and cartilage","Sinuses","Teeth","Small hairs and mucus"
"The nose is also responsible for the sense of smell, as it houses the olfactory receptors.","What sense does the nose contribute to?","Smell","Taste","Touch","Sight","Smell"
"These receptors send signals to the brain, allowing us to perceive different scents.","What do olfactory receptors in the nose do?","Send signals to the brain for scent perception","Filter dust from the air","Help with speech production","Warm the air we breathe","Send signals to the brain for scent perception"
"In comparison to the mouth, the nose is more effective at warming and humidifying the air we breathe.","How does the nose compare to the mouth in air processing?","The nose is more effective at warming and humidifying the air","The mouth is more effective at warming and humidifying the air","The mouth filters air better","The nose and mouth work equally in processing air","The nose is more effective at warming and humidifying the air"
"The external part of the nose, known as the nose bridge, is composed of bone, while the tip is cartilage.","What is the external part of the nose composed of?","Bone in the bridge and cartilage in the tip","Cartilage throughout","Bone throughout","Only cartilage","Bone in the bridge and cartilage in the tip"
"Nostrils, also known as nares, are the openings through which air enters and exits the nose.","What are nostrils also called?","Nares","Sinuses","Passages","Olfactory receptors","Nares"
"The septum divides the two nasal cavities, ensuring that air flows symmetrically.","What does the septum do?","Divides the two nasal cavities","Filters the air","Heats the air","Helps with speech production","Divides the two nasal cavities"
"If the septum is deviated, it can cause breathing difficulties.","What happens if the septum is deviated?","Breathing difficulties","Enhanced sense of smell","Clearer speech","Improved air humidification","Breathing difficulties"
"The nasal passages are lined with mucous membranes that help trap bacteria and prevent infections.","What lines the nasal passages to help prevent infections?","Mucous membranes","Bone and cartilage","Sinuses","Nostrils","Mucous membranes"
"The nose also plays a crucial role in speech, as it resonates sound produced in the vocal cords.","How does the nose contribute to speech?","Resonates sound produced in the vocal cords","Filters sound","Produces sound","Translates speech signals to the brain","Resonates sound produced in the vocal cords"
"Air passes through the sinuses, which are hollow cavities within the facial bones that help with voice resonance.","What role do the sinuses play?","Help with voice resonance","Filter air","Warm the air","Produce mucus","Help with voice resonance"
"Individuals with a blocked nose may experience difficulty breathing, impacting their ability to speak clearly.","What happens if the nose is blocked?","Difficulty breathing and speaking clearly","Loss of taste and smell","Increased air humidity","Better air filtration","Difficulty breathing and speaking clearly"
"Loss of the sense of smell can indicate damage to the olfactory receptors or other underlying health issues.","What can loss of smell indicate?","Damage to olfactory receptors or health issues","Cold or flu","Difficulty in breathing","Blocked nostrils","Damage to olfactory receptors or health issues"
"Overall, the nose is vital not just for breathing but also for sensory functions.","What is the overall function of the nose?","Breathing and sensory functions","Only for breathing","Only for sensory functions","For speech production only","Breathing and sensory functions"
