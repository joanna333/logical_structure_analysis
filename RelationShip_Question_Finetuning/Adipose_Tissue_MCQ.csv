Text,Question,Option A,Option B,Option C,Option D,Answer
"Adipose tissue is not just a storage depot for fat but also an endocrine organ, playing a crucial role in the body's energy balance.", "What is the primary function of adipose tissue?", "Storage of fat only", "Energy regulation and fat storage", "Secretion of digestive enzymes", "Maintaining blood pressure", "Energy regulation and fat storage"
"Adipose tissue secretes hormones such as leptin and adiponectin, which have significant effects on metabolism and appetite.", "What hormones are secreted by adipose tissue?", "Insulin and glucagon", "Leptin and adiponectin", "Cortisol and adrenaline", "Estrogen and progesterone", "Leptin and adiponectin"
"Leptin helps to regulate food intake and energy expenditure, while adiponectin plays a role in glucose regulation and insulin sensitivity.", "What is the role of leptin in the body?", "Regulates blood pressure", "Regulates food intake and energy expenditure", "Improves bone density", "Stimulates muscle growth", "Regulates food intake and energy expenditure"
"This feedback loop is essential for maintaining energy balance and preventing excessive fat accumulation or depletion.", "What does the feedback loop in adipose tissue help maintain?", "Energy balance and prevent extreme fat accumulation", "Bone density", "Muscle mass", "Blood sugar regulation", "Energy balance and prevent extreme fat accumulation"
"Adipose tissue's endocrine functions highlight its importance beyond just a fat-storing organ, demonstrating its active role in metabolic health.", "Why are the endocrine functions of adipose tissue important?", "Because they regulate fat storage", "Because they play a key role in metabolic health", "Because they help digest food", "Because they regulate blood flow", "Because they play a key role in metabolic health"
"Understanding these functions can lead to better strategies for managing obesity and metabolic disorders.", "What can understanding adipose tissue's functions help with?", "Managing obesity and metabolic disorders", "Improving skin health", "Reducing muscle fatigue", "Enhancing digestion", "Managing obesity and metabolic disorders"
"Thus, adipose tissue's endocrine functions are vital for the body's ability to maintain energy balance and overall health.", "Why are adipose tissue's endocrine functions vital?", "They maintain blood pressure", "They help maintain energy balance and overall health", "They regulate breathing", "They control heart rate", "They help maintain energy balance and overall health"
