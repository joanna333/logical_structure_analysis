"The amniotic fluid within the sac provides cushioning to the fetus, protecting it from physical shocks.","What does amniotic fluid do?","Provides cushioning to the fetus","Supports the fetus's growth","Helps in fetal digestion","Allows fetal movement","Provides cushioning to the fetus"
"This sac also maintains a stable temperature for the developing fetus, helping it grow in a controlled environment.","What does the amniotic sac help maintain?","A stable temperature for the fetus","Fetal respiration","Fetal blood circulation","Fetal nutrition","A stable temperature for the fetus"
"Amniotic fluid allows the fetus to move freely, promoting the development of muscles and bones.","What does amniotic fluid allow the fetus to do?","Move freely, promoting muscle and bone development","Breathe properly","Regulate body temperature","Develop sensory organs","Move freely, promoting muscle and bone development"
"The amniotic sac plays a key role in fetal lung development, as the fetus ‘breathes’ the fluid, which is essential for lung growth.","How does the amniotic sac help fetal lung development?","The fetus 'breathes' the fluid, which is essential for lung growth","By supplying oxygen through the blood","By preventing fluid from entering the lungs","By controlling the amount of air in the lungs","The fetus 'breathes' the fluid, which is essential for lung growth"
"Changes in the volume or composition of amniotic fluid can indicate certain pregnancy-related complications, such as oligohydramnios or polyhydramnios.","What can changes in amniotic fluid indicate?","Pregnancy-related complications such as oligohydramnios or polyhydramnios","The baby's gender","The baby's growth rate","The need for a C-section","Pregnancy-related complications such as oligohydramnios or polyhydramnios"
"During labor, the rupture of the amniotic sac, known as the 'water breaking,' signals the onset of childbirth.","What does the rupture of the amniotic sac signal?","The onset of childbirth","The baby's first movement","The start of the third trimester","The need for a cesarean section","The onset of childbirth"
"In cases of preterm labor, the early rupture of the amniotic sac can lead to complications for both the mother and the baby.","What can early rupture of the amniotic sac in preterm labor cause?","Complications for both the mother and the baby","A smooth delivery","Immediate recovery for the mother","No complications","Complications for both the mother and the baby"
"The integrity of the amniotic sac is essential for the protection and nourishment of the fetus throughout pregnancy.","Why is the integrity of the amniotic sac important?","It is essential for the protection and nourishment of the fetus","It helps control the mother's blood pressure","It supports the placenta","It provides oxygen to the fetus","It is essential for the protection and nourishment of the fetus"
"In rare cases, an infection can affect the amniotic sac, leading to conditions like chorioamnionitis that can threaten maternal and fetal health.","What can an infection of the amniotic sac lead to?","Conditions like chorioamnionitis","Fetal lung development problems","Abnormal fetal movement","Increased amniotic fluid production","Conditions like chorioamnionitis"
"Overall, the amniotic sac serves as an essential component of pregnancy, providing protection, nourishment, and a stable environment for fetal development.","What is the role of the amniotic sac in pregnancy?","Providing protection, nourishment, and a stable environment for fetal development","Regulating the mother's blood pressure","Delivering oxygen to the fetus","Controlling the baby's heart rate","Providing protection, nourishment, and a stable environment for fetal development"
