One of the primary functions of the placenta is to facilitate nutrient and gas exchange between the mother and fetus.,Definition
The placenta serves as the interface through which oxygen is transferred from maternal blood to the fetus.,Explanation
"Additionally, it removes waste products such as carbon dioxide from the fetal blood, which are then eliminated by the mother's body.",Addition
"The placenta's structure and function change as pregnancy progresses, adapting to the growing needs of the fetus.",Temporal Sequence
"Because the fetus cannot breathe on its own in the womb, the placenta ensures adequate oxygen delivery throughout pregnancy.",Cause and Effect
"However, in the absence of a healthy placenta, fetal development can be severely compromised.",Contrast
"If the placenta fails to function correctly, the fetus may suffer from hypoxia or inadequate nutrition.",Conditional
"Unlike the fetal circulatory system, the placenta allows for the exchange of gases and nutrients without direct mixing of maternal and fetal blood.",Comparison
"The placenta also plays a vital role in protecting the fetus from infections, acting as a selective barrier.",Explanation
"This barrier, however, is not perfect, and some pathogens can still pass through, especially in certain conditions.",Concession
"Therefore, the placenta is not only a means of exchange but also a critical organ in maintaining fetal immunity.",Cause and Effect
The placenta's ability to regulate the transport of nutrients and gases can be affected by factors such as maternal health and environmental conditions.,Generalization
"In cases of maternal malnutrition, for example, the placenta might prioritize the delivery of nutrients to the fetus over the mother.",Problem Solution
"As a result, this may lead to restricted fetal growth or developmental delays.",Cause and Effect
"The placenta also produces several hormones, including human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), which is crucial for maintaining pregnancy.",Explanation
"Another important hormone, progesterone, ensures the uterine environment remains conducive to fetal growth.",Enumeration
"Moreover, estrogen, produced by the placenta, helps in the development of maternal tissues and the growth of the fetus.",Addition
These hormones are essential for regulating both maternal and fetal physiology throughout pregnancy.,Emphasis
"Over time, the placenta's role shifts from merely supporting the fetus to actively regulating various aspects of both maternal and fetal health.",Sequential
The placenta also helps in the synthesis of fatty acids and proteins necessary for fetal development.,Clarification
"Because of its multiple roles, the placenta is often referred to as the 'life-support' organ for the fetus.",Explanation
The placenta is capable of adjusting the supply of nutrients depending on the fetus's stage of development.,Elaboration
"In some pregnancies, however, placental insufficiency can occur, limiting the fetus's access to necessary nutrients.",Contrast
"The exchange of substances is also influenced by the placental surface area, which increases as pregnancy advances.",Cause and Effect
"Some substances, such as oxygen, are transferred passively, while others require active transport mechanisms.",Explanation
"The placenta's complex structure ensures efficient exchange, with blood from the mother and fetus flowing in close proximity but never directly mixing.",Definition
"Despite its importance, the placenta is not fully understood, and ongoing research continues to reveal its many functions.",Inference
"Given its multifaceted role in fetal development, the placenta is a crucial organ for a healthy pregnancy.",Summary
"Thus, maintaining a healthy placenta is essential for the well-being of both the mother and fetus throughout pregnancy.",Purpose
"While the placenta supports fetal growth, it also adapts to various maternal needs, balancing resources between mother and child.",Contrastive Emphasis
"In the case of complications such as preeclampsia, the placenta can malfunction, leading to serious consequences for both the fetus and the mother.",Problem Solution
