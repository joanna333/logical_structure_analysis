"An action potential is a rapid, temporary change in the membrane potential of a neuron.",Definition
"When a neuron is at rest, its membrane potential is negative, around -70 mV.",Explanation
The process of generating an action potential begins when a neuron is stimulated to a threshold level.,Causal
"As the stimulus depolarizes the membrane, sodium (Na+) channels open, allowing Na+ to flow into the neuron.",Cause and Effect
"If the stimulus is strong enough to reach the threshold, it triggers an action potential.",Conditional
"The influx of sodium ions makes the inside of the neuron more positive, causing further depolarization.",Sequential
"Once the membrane reaches a certain threshold, voltage-gated sodium channels open fully.",Sequential
"This results in a rapid depolarization of the membrane, where the inside becomes positive compared to the outside.",Explanation
"At the peak of the action potential, sodium channels close and potassium (K+) channels open.",Sequential
"Potassium ions then flow out of the neuron, causing the membrane potential to become more negative again.",Cause and Effect
"This phase is known as repolarization, and it restores the membrane to its resting potential.",Explanation
"After repolarization, the sodium-potassium pump restores the resting ion concentrations by actively pumping Na+ out and K+ in.",Cause and Effect
"The entire process of depolarization, repolarization, and restoration occurs in a matter of milliseconds.",Temporal Sequence
"However, during the action potential, the neuron cannot be stimulated to fire another action potential immediately.",Contrast
"This period is known as the refractory period, and it ensures the action potential travels in one direction.",Clarification
"During the refractory period, the neuron is either partially or completely unable to fire another action potential.",Explanation
"Action potentials are an 'all-or-nothing' event, meaning once they are initiated, they will always reach the same peak amplitude.",Generalization
"This is in contrast to graded potentials, which can vary in strength depending on the stimulus.",Contrast
The propagation of an action potential along the axon occurs through a process called saltatory conduction in myelinated neurons.,Explanation
Saltatory conduction is much faster than continuous conduction in unmyelinated neurons.,Comparison
"The myelin sheath, made of glial cells, acts as an insulator, speeding up the action potential's travel down the axon.",Explanation
"As the action potential reaches a node of Ranvier, the depolarization jumps from one node to the next.",Sequential
This jumping process allows the action potential to travel rapidly across long distances.,Cause and Effect
"Unmyelinated axons conduct action potentials more slowly due to the lack of insulation, resulting in continuous conduction.",Contrast
"The action potential propagates in one direction, from the dendrites to the axon terminals, due to the refractory period.",Explanation
"In myelinated neurons, the action potential can travel faster due to the reduced number of channels needed to propagate it.",Cause and Effect
An action potential can be considered a communication signal that transmits information within the nervous system.,Explanation
"The signal travels from the neuronâ€™s axon terminals to other neurons or muscles, where it triggers a response.",Purpose
"Once the action potential reaches the axon terminals, it causes the release of neurotransmitters into the synapse.",Sequential
"These neurotransmitters bind to receptors on the next cell, initiating a new electrical signal.",Sequential
"In this way, the action potential ensures the efficient transmission of information throughout the nervous system.",Summary
