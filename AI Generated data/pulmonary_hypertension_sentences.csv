Sentence,Label
Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is a condition characterized by high blood pressure in the arteries of the lungs.,Definition
"In pulmonary hypertension, the walls of the pulmonary arteries become thickened and stiff, leading to increased resistance to blood flow.",Explanation
"Consequently, the heart's right ventricle has to work harder to pump blood through the lungs.",Cause and Effect
This increased workload on the right side of the heart can lead to right heart failure over time.,Cause and Effect
"As the disease progresses, the right ventricle may become enlarged and weakened.",Sequential
"The condition can lead to symptoms such as shortness of breath, fatigue, and chest pain.",Enumeration
"Typically, the onset of pulmonary hypertension is insidious, and symptoms may not be noticeable until the disease has advanced.",Temporal Sequence
"People with pulmonary hypertension may also experience swelling in the legs and abdomen, due to fluid retention.",Addition
"In the early stages, patients might not show any clear signs of the disease.",Contrast
"However, once symptoms appear, they tend to worsen over time if left untreated.",Cause and Effect
"One of the primary causes of pulmonary hypertension is left-sided heart disease, where the left side of the heart fails to pump effectively.",Explanation
"If the left side of the heart is weakened, pressure increases in the pulmonary veins, ultimately leading to pulmonary hypertension.",Cause and Effect
"Another cause of PH is chronic lung disease, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), which reduces oxygen levels in the blood.",Cause and Effect
"In contrast, pulmonary arterial hypertension is a rarer form that occurs without any apparent cause or due to genetic mutations.",Contrast
"Additionally, certain conditions like blood clots or autoimmune diseases can also contribute to the development of pulmonary hypertension.",Addition
"Severe cases of pulmonary hypertension may require surgical intervention, such as a lung transplant or the use of heart-lung machines.",Problem Solution
"Medical treatments for pulmonary hypertension include medications that relax the pulmonary arteries, such as prostacyclins and endothelin receptor antagonists.",Enumeration
"These medications work by improving blood flow through the lungs, which in turn eases the strain on the right side of the heart.",Explanation
"Patients may also need oxygen therapy to increase blood oxygen levels, which can improve overall heart and lung function.",Addition
"Pulmonary hypertension is typically diagnosed through imaging tests, such as echocardiograms, as well as blood tests and right heart catheterization.",Definition
A right heart catheterization involves inserting a catheter into the heart to measure pulmonary artery pressure directly.,Clarification
"Pulmonary hypertension is more commonly seen in individuals with a history of heart disease, lung disease, or obesity.",Generalization
"Therefore, it is important to regularly monitor these individuals for early signs of the disease.",Purpose
"Over time, untreated pulmonary hypertension can lead to a progressive decline in quality of life and can be fatal.",Cause and Effect
"In conclusion, pulmonary hypertension is a complex and serious condition that requires careful management to prevent worsening of symptoms.",Summary
"Patients with pulmonary hypertension often need a combination of lifestyle changes, medications, and ongoing medical supervision to manage the condition.",Elaboration
"Despite available treatments, pulmonary hypertension remains a challenging condition, with variable outcomes depending on the underlying cause.",Concession
"Compared to other forms of hypertension, pulmonary hypertension involves more direct consequences for the heart's ability to function properly.",Comparison
"Ultimately, the goal of treatment for pulmonary hypertension is to reduce symptoms, improve quality of life, and prevent the progression of the disease.",Purpose
Early diagnosis and intervention can significantly improve outcomes for patients with pulmonary hypertension.,Inference
"In contrast to primary pulmonary hypertension, which has no known cause, secondary pulmonary hypertension is often linked to other health conditions.",Contrast
"Pulmonary hypertension is a global health issue that affects millions of people worldwide, with increasing recognition of its severity.",Emphasis
"Although pulmonary hypertension is not curable, advancements in treatment have helped many patients manage their condition more effectively.",Concession
