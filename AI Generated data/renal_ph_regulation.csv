Sentence,Label
The kidneys play a critical role in maintaining the body's pH balance by regulating hydrogen ion (H+) levels and bicarbonate (HCO3-) concentrations.,Definition
"To lower the blood's acidity, the kidneys excrete hydrogen ions into the urine, thereby removing excess acid from the body.",Causal
"If the blood becomes too acidic, the kidneys increase the excretion of hydrogen ions to restore balance.",Conditional
The process of hydrogen ion elimination is closely linked with the reabsorption of bicarbonate in the proximal convoluted tubule.,Sequential
"In contrast to the lungs, which can adjust pH by altering CO2 levels, the kidneys provide a slower, but more precise, regulation of pH.",Comparison
The kidneys help maintain a stable blood pH by regulating the ratio of bicarbonate to carbonic acid.,Explanation
Bicarbonate ions are critical for buffering acids in the body and can be reabsorbed by the kidneys to prevent acidosis.,Emphasis
The renal tubules actively secrete hydrogen ions into the urine and reclaim bicarbonate from the filtrate.,Cause and Effect
"In addition to hydrogen ion excretion, the kidneys produce new bicarbonate ions, which enter the bloodstream to counteract excess acidity.",Addition
"Proximal tubule cells are responsible for much of the bicarbonate reabsorption, while the distal tubule fine-tunes pH by secreting hydrogen ions.",Elaboration
An example of the kidneys' contribution to pH regulation can be seen during metabolic acidosis when the kidneys increase hydrogen ion excretion.,Illustration
"Although other organs contribute to pH balance, such as the lungs through CO2 regulation, the kidneys provide a longer-term solution.",Concession
"Generally, the kidneys' ability to regulate pH is essential for maintaining homeostasis in the body's various systems.",Generalization
"By adjusting the secretion of hydrogen ions and reabsorption of bicarbonate, the kidneys help keep the blood's pH within a narrow range of 7.35â€“7.45.",Inference
The primary purpose of renal pH regulation is to maintain the body's acid-base homeostasis by eliminating excess acids and conserving base.,Purpose
"The kidneys can increase the secretion of hydrogen ions when the blood becomes too acidic, helping to restore normal pH levels.",Clarification
"Throughout the nephron, different mechanisms contribute to pH regulation, including the secretion of hydrogen ions and the reabsorption of bicarbonate.",Enumeration
"Hydrogen ions are secreted into the lumen of the nephron, where they combine with buffers like phosphate to be excreted in the urine.",Cause and Effect
"During acidosis, the kidneys compensate by increasing the production of new bicarbonate ions that are added to the blood.",Temporal Sequence
"In cases of alkalosis, the kidneys may reduce bicarbonate reabsorption and increase the secretion of bicarbonate into the urine.",Temporal Sequence
"By actively secreting hydrogen ions, the kidneys adjust the blood's pH when it falls below normal levels.",Causal
"While bicarbonate is largely reabsorbed in the proximal convoluted tubule, some of it is also reabsorbed in the distal tubule for fine-tuning.",Addition
Renal pH regulation becomes particularly important during conditions like renal failure when the kidneys' ability to excrete hydrogen ions is impaired.,Problem Solution
"Compared to respiratory regulation, the kidneys take longer to respond but can maintain pH balance for a much longer period.",Contrastive Emphasis
"Through the renal regulation of pH, the kidneys help balance the effects of acidic and basic substances in the bloodstream.",Purpose
"If the kidneys are unable to excrete sufficient hydrogen ions, it can lead to chronic acid-base imbalances such as metabolic acidosis.",Conditional
"Renal pH regulation involves the interplay between hydrogen ion secretion, bicarbonate reabsorption, and the production of new bicarbonate.",Clarification
"By understanding how the kidneys regulate pH, we can better appreciate their role in overall homeostasis and metabolic function.",Summary
