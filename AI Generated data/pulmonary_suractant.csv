Sentence,Label
Pulmonary surfactant is a complex mixture of lipids and proteins secreted by the cells in the lungs.,Definition
"Without pulmonary surfactant, the lungs would not be able to expand properly during breathing.",Cause and Effect
"Pulmonary surfactant reduces surface tension in the lungs, allowing for easier lung expansion during inhalation.",Explanation
"If the production of pulmonary surfactant is insufficient, the risk of respiratory distress syndrome increases.",Conditional
"Pulmonary surfactant is essential for preventing alveolar collapse, especially at the end of expiration.",Purpose
"One important component of pulmonary surfactant is dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC), which has surfactant properties.",Explanation
"Compared to water, which has high surface tension, pulmonary surfactant reduces this tension by a significant amount.",Comparison
"Surfactant production increases as a fetus approaches full term, ensuring that the lungs are prepared for breathing air.",Temporal Sequence
The primary function of pulmonary surfactant is to reduce surface tension at the air-liquid interface within the alveoli.,Clarification
"By lowering surface tension, pulmonary surfactant prevents the alveoli from collapsing when the lungs deflate.",Cause and Effect
"Pulmonary surfactant is produced by type II alveolar cells, which are specialized epithelial cells in the lungs.",Explanation
"Without this surfactant, the alveoli would stick together, making it much harder for the lungs to expand.",Explanation
"In patients with lung diseases such as emphysema or ARDS, the function of surfactant may be impaired.",Contrast
"After the first few breaths at birth, the production of pulmonary surfactant continues to be crucial throughout life.",Temporal Sequence
Pulmonary surfactant plays a key role in maintaining the stability of the alveolar structure during the respiratory cycle.,Elaboration
"Although surfactant production starts before birth, premature infants often lack enough surfactant, which complicates breathing.",Concession
The surface tension within the lungs can lead to difficulty in breathing without the proper functioning of pulmonary surfactant.,Cause and Effect
"Because of surfactant's role in reducing surface tension, the lungs can expand more easily with less effort.",Explanation
"To illustrate, surfactant molecules line the alveolar surface and form a barrier that reduces tension during lung expansion.",Illustration
"When pulmonary surfactant is deficient or dysfunctional, it leads to conditions such as neonatal respiratory distress syndrome (NRDS).",Problem Solution
"Pulmonary surfactant also helps to regulate the surface tension in the lungs during the breathing process, preventing atelectasis.",Elaboration
Respiratory function is greatly impaired when there is a lack of surfactant because the alveoli cannot stay open properly.,Cause and Effect
"Once the surfactant reduces surface tension, the lungs become more compliant and easier to ventilate.",Cause and Effect
The effectiveness of pulmonary surfactant depends on the balance between its lipid and protein components.,Comparison
"Surfactant is not only produced in adults, but it also plays a crucial role in fetal lung development.",Addition
Pulmonary surfactant is produced more rapidly towards the end of pregnancy to ensure the newborn's lungs can function immediately after birth.,Temporal Sequence
"While surfactant is essential for lung function, it also protects the lungs by reducing the likelihood of fluid accumulation.",Purpose
"In some respiratory diseases, surfactant therapy is used to support patients with impaired lung function.",Problem Solution
Pulmonary surfactant works to reduce surface tension more effectively than water or other liquids due to its unique molecular structure.,Comparison
"An adequate amount of pulmonary surfactant is vital for normal respiratory function, especially in newborns.",Emphasis
"Surfactant production begins early in fetal development, but it only becomes fully effective around 34-36 weeks of gestation.",Temporal Sequence
"Surface tension is greatly reduced with surfactant, which is essential for efficient gas exchange in the alveoli.",Cause and Effect
Pulmonary surfactant is a critical factor in ensuring that the lungs are capable of expanding and contracting with minimal resistance.,Purpose
