Sentence,Label
"The cardiac cycle begins with the generation of an electrical impulse in the sinoatrial node, which serves as the heart's natural pacemaker.",Definition
"This impulse travels through the atria, causing them to contract and push blood into the ventricles.",Cause and Effect
"If the sinoatrial node fails, the heart's rhythm may be taken over by other slower pacemakers, such as the atrioventricular node.",Conditional
"The electrical impulse then reaches the atrioventricular node, where a slight delay allows the ventricles to fill with blood before contraction.",Sequential
"In comparison to atrial contraction, ventricular contraction generates much higher pressure to pump blood through the body.",Comparison
The cardiac cycle is a coordinated process of electrical and mechanical activities that ensures continuous blood flow.,Explanation
"While atrial contraction contributes to ventricular filling, most of the filling occurs passively during diastole.",Contrast
"After leaving the atrioventricular node, the impulse travels down the bundle of His and into the Purkinje fibers, stimulating ventricular contraction.",Addition
"The contraction of the ventricles forces blood out through the pulmonary artery and aorta, which are the main outflow vessels of the heart.",Emphasis
"The relaxation phase of the cycle, known as diastole, allows the heart chambers to refill with blood.",Elaboration
"During systole, the ventricles generate enough pressure to overcome the resistance in the aorta and pulmonary arteries.",Illustration
"Although the heart operates autonomously, its rhythm is influenced by the autonomic nervous system to adapt to varying demands.",Concession
"Generally, the heart completes this cycle in less than one second under normal conditions.",Generalization
"By observing the synchronization of electrical and mechanical phases, clinicians can infer potential abnormalities such as arrhythmias.",Inference
The cardiac cycle can be summarized as alternating phases of contraction and relaxation that enable efficient blood circulation.,Summary
"When the heart encounters issues like valve stenosis, it must work harder, leading to potential cardiac strain.",Problem Solution
"Despite its complexity, the cycle depends on a precisely timed series of events to maintain effective blood flow.",Contrastive Emphasis
The primary purpose of the cardiac cycle is to supply oxygen-rich blood to tissues while removing metabolic waste products.,Purpose
The delay at the atrioventricular node ensures that atrial contraction is completed before ventricular contraction begins.,Clarification
"The phases of the cardiac cycle can be broken down into atrial systole, ventricular systole, and diastole.",Enumeration
The contraction of cardiac muscle fibers is initiated by the depolarization wave from electrical impulses.,Cause and Effect
"Over time, the sequence of events ensures that oxygen-depleted blood is sent to the lungs for oxygenation and returned to the body.",Temporal Sequence
"First, the atria contract, followed by ventricular contraction, and finally, a relaxation phase completes the cycle.",Temporal Sequence
The rapid ejection phase of ventricular systole is characterized by a sharp increase in pressure and blood flow into the arteries.,Illustration
"While the ventricles are pumping blood out, the atria are simultaneously filling with blood for the next cycle.",Concession
The heart relies on tight coupling of electrical signals and mechanical responses to function effectively.,Purpose
"A malfunction in the conduction system, such as a block in the bundle of His, can disrupt the sequence of contractions.",Problem Solution
Comparing the left and right sides of the heart reveals that the left ventricle generates much higher pressure to supply systemic circulation.,Comparison
"The precise coordination of electrical activity ensures that blood flows in a unidirectional manner, preventing backflow.",Explanation
"Overall, the cardiac cycle exemplifies how finely tuned biological systems sustain vital physiological functions.",Summary
